    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p id="instruct-text" align="left">On the following pages, you will see several conversations. 
      At then end of each one, there will be a sentence in red text.
      <br><br>
      
      After reading the conversation and the sentence in red, consider the two sentences on either end of the scale. One will contain the word <b>could</b> and one will contain the word <b>should</b>. Rate which best expresses the meaning of the sentence in red. If both sentences seem like a good fit for the meaning of the sentence in red, choose a number in the middle of the scale.
