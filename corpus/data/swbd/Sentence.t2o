133:24	and everybody had duties 0 *-1 to perform *T*-2 . E_S
901:67	I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has *T*-1 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , E_S
902:24	and then they feel an obligation *-1 to respond even though there 's not even a person there . E_S
975:33	because , you do n't have anyway 0 *-1 to turn it off *T*-2 . E_S
1098:41	But it does mean that you have yet another reason 0 *-1 to follow a set of social norms *T*-2 . E_S
1234:15	time 0 * to , you know , start *-1 going to bed *T*-2 E_S
1240:27	Now , I agree with their right * to , uh , pursue their religion of choice , in \[ that , \+ whatever \] manner 0 they want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , E_S
1369:31	It 's kind of an easy thing 0 * to talk about *T*-1 . E_S
1425:42	I do n't think that men really took the time 0 * to work on that sort of thing *T*-1 . E_S
1466:39	I think 0 that would be a wonderful way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
1694:68	Well , um , \[ I do n't have that , \+ I do n't have that \] , experience 0 *-1 to share *T*-2 . E_S
1875:33	I me- , there was no reason for him to really come into , you know , great stardom or anything . E_S
1946:52	I mean , I like , you know , \[ things \+ \] like *-1 to hear , you know , what they call *T*-2 world music . Which *T*-3 is , you know , * using all these natural forms of music E_S
2216:41	that 's \[ a , \+ a \] big thing 0 * to think about *T*-1 . E_S
2254:65	and , uh , * not being a native of Texas , but being here eleven years * have a tendency * to , uh , find out \[ the , \+ uh , about the \] different areas \[ of the co- , \+ \[ of the , \+ of the \] state \] by *-2 reading it . E_S
2271:143	* being an engineer in facilities I do read \[ a lot of , \+ a lot of , \] uh , building magazines \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] plant engineering magazines *ICH*-1 and , read up on different ways 0 * to do things *T*-2 and energy management type of magazines E_S
2641:44	I do n't know that that would be a good environment 0 * to work in *T*-1 . E_S
2738:29	\[ That 's the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . \+ I mean that 's the smart way 0 * to do it *T*-2 . \] E_S
3473:72	I mean it 's just that , like \[ the , \+ the \] sixties music 's got a lot 0 * to say *T*-1 . E_S
3570:26	that 's a good example 0 * to look for *T*-1 in history . E_S
3859:64	an , I think 0 that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there 's more 0 for them to do *T*-1 . E_S
4040:67	And \[ I , \+ I \] particularly enjoy , I do n't know whether you 've had a chance *-1 to watch it on P B S but uh , the series , uh , YES MINISTER ? E_S
4484:77	It says 0 \[ ever- , \+ \] all sorts of factors go into health and 0 there 's no reason 0 * to talk about one rather than another *T*-1 , so that \[ they , \+ they \] combined them all together . E_S
4562:19	The rat race 0 *T*-1 to exercise . E_S
4874:38	I mean , You know , the way 0 * to stop that kind of behavior *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] two-fold . E_S
4920:40	they just think 0 that 's the normal thing 0 * to do *T*-1 , do n't they ... E_S
5079:27	I 've got the kits 0 * to put them all in *T*-1 . E_S
5203:64	I mean it is relaxing 0 * to do *T*-2 , once you find the time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
5254:30	now I 've got the material 0 * to do an afghan that I just never did get around to * finishing it *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
5262:76	\[ Lilly , \+ Lilly \] , \[ she said , \+ she said \] 0 it 's for your daughter 0 * to use *T*-1 . E_S
6225:34	I guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , E_S
6257:38	So , I have *-1 to find a way 0 * to supplement that *T*-2 . E_S
6262:40	but I 've got money coming out MUMBLEx *ICH*-2 0 * to buy savings bonds *T*-1 , just coming straight out of my check . E_S
6349:74	\[ And , \+ and \] our answer was , that , you know , we will have enough money *ICH*-1 available for him to attend a state college . E_S
6350:57	And if he wants *-1 to go to a private college , he can get a scholarship * to attend , you know . E_S
6369:44	* Let , me explain to you how you get scholarships * to do that *T*-1 . E_S
6384:44	* Let me explain to you how you get scholarships , * to do that *T*-1 . E_S
6431:40	and they said that T I was looking into it , * to purchase extra vacation days . Which I thought 0 *T*-1 sounded like a good idea . E_S
6600:97	You wonder if * being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them *T*-1 would actually say , Hey , that 's not a bad way 0 * to do it *T*-2 , E_S
6619:89	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess , 0 in my own , * having had the whole three or four minutes 0 * to , you know , give it a great deal of thought *T*-1 , you know , Um , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary , E_S
6773:39	She started some type of , um , national organization for youth to volunteer *-2 to \[ teach , \+ tutor \] other kids to read and , you know , do different service projects like that and trying * to get youth more directed towards , you know , helpful things , E_S
7156:27	so I never have time 0 * to deal with them *T*-1 . E_S
7354:31	That 's , uh , only way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
7367:54	but , you know , * seems like there 's just so many things 0 * to do *T*-1 down here , E_S
7542:69	and then once they do get elected *-1 , they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness 0 *-4 to do those things that they promised *T*-2 , you know , beforehand *T*-3 . E_S
7739:54	Well , what do you think *T*-1 about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player 0 *T*-2 to earn a million dollars ? E_S
7892:34	Oh . Well , that 's the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
7939:25	Is that a tough system 0 * to be in *T*-1 ? E_S
8269:24	I do n't have the patience *-1 to read . E_S
8339:27	we were the fourth *ICH*-1 0 *T*-2 to build out of three hundred and forty houses . E_S
8343:48	So , I would , uh , not recommend F and J house 0 for my dog to live in *T*-1 , uh , because they 're overpriced , uh , E_S
8347:55	and , um , you can call it a home because it 's a place 0 * to go home and keep the rain off your head *T*-1 , E_S
8413:23	well , have you any plans * to , uh , maybe , uh , expand or move onward ? E_S
8602:33	basically the United States is the cheapest country 0 * to call out of *T*-1 . E_S
8619:27	Um , I got money 0 * to pay that , too *T*-1 . E_S
8876:26	but then , I get the opportunity *-1 to vacuum , E_S
8893:24	I have n't had much opportunity *-1 to work on any other craft stuff lately E_S
8917:58	She enjoys *-1 doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something 0 * to cover \[ her , \+ her \] legs and feet with *T*-2 while she is working on it . E_S
8976:61	Well , I guess \[ 0 that 's , \+ 0 that 's \] one way 0 * to end a conversation *T*-1 . E_S
9021:38	and I 'm not sure when a good time 0 * to plant those *T*-2 is *T*-1 , if they should be planted *-3 early or later . E_S
9243:26	now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *T*-1 , so that we do n't , uh , run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *T*-2 E_S
9910:28	but there 's no food 0 for them to buy *T*-1 , E_S
9925:34	they 've got a lot of adjustments 0 * to make *T*-1 with *-3 coming out of what they 've been through *T*-2 now , E_S
9931:27	when they give you the freedom * to take care of yourself *T*-1 then that puts some responsibility on you as well . E_S
11089:24	There 's just not any push * to recycle . E_S
11120:77	Um , I put out \[ a , \+ a \] trash can \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] 0 for people to put their aluminum cans in *T*-1 , E_S
11276:24	Those are perfect boxes 0 * to put files in *T*-1 . E_S
11410:30	or we did n't have time 0 * to do those bins *T*-1 or something E_S
12066:96	The , uh , United States and Canada \[ \[ are I guess , \+ is , \] \+ is , \] going into , uh , some types of agreements * to limit , uh , what *T*-1 's being given *-2 out by power plants , E_S
12381:53	\[ if , \+ if \] you remember , the vote in the Congress 0 * to authorize war *T*-1 , if necessary , was actually pretty close . E_S
12419:75	but , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know that there 's a lot of reasons 0 * to wait longer *T*-1 E_S
13175:72	Uh , I think that , uh , really it *EXP*-1 would n't hurt most of the young people of the country * to have * to go and do voluntary service . E_S
13261:34	but , uh , it gave them something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
13303:34	but I have n't had that much time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , either . E_S
13345:89	and you wonder , well , who *T*-1 's going *-2 to get ahold of this and think , um , that 's a nice place 0 * to go *-3 rob *T*-4 . E_S
13449:82	I know 0 when I sit down with the family and want *-1 to have the opportunity , \[ you know , \+ \] * to talk and see what *T*-2 's going on and all those things *T*-3 , E_S
13738:72	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know that I , uh , felt myself necessarily encumbered *-1 with the necessity * to have heirs . E_S
14000:54	but \[ I , \+ I \] do n't really have too much more 0 * to say *T*-1 on this topic , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
14034:30	I do n't usually have time 0 * to read the newspaper everyday *T*-1 , E_S
14053:43	On the whole , I 'm pleased when I have an opportunity * to hear just the facts *T*-1 . E_S
14076:63	\[ They 're , \+ maybe they 're \] a little more efficient , or have more 0 * to do *T*-1 over that same time frame . E_S
14227:30	and it gives me a quick chance * \[ to , \+ to \] be caught *-1 up during the day .
14227:38	and it gives me a quick chance * \[ to , \+ to \] be caught *-1 up during the day .
14380:24	So they were in a shot *-1 to make the play-offs E_S
14828:21	and he had enough money * to , you know , N_S
15000:24	that 's one way 0 * to do it *T*-1 , because \[ that , \+ that \] forces you to pay for it instead of *-2 saying , well , I 'll just pay on it this month E_S
15080:22	I have nothing 0 * to say *T*-1 about this . E_S
15197:82	Uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really for the community \[ * to give , you know , * \[ to , \+ to \] give \] back to the community type of thing . E_S
15197:90	Uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really for the community \[ * to give , you know , * \[ to , \+ to \] give \] back to the community type of thing . E_S
15447:42	it 's just 0 I have n't had the time 0 * to go to the movies lately *T*-1 . E_S
15560:96	because , uh , just generally , you know , that kind of scary stuff \[ I , \+ I \] just do n't want *-1 to have anything 0 * to do *T*-2 with it . E_S
15620:32	we just have n't had the time 0 * to go to the movies lately *T*-1 , E_S
16071:26	That 's the best way 0 * to stop it *T*-1 . E_S
16970:75	but it seems as though if you really want *-2 to set \[ a t- , \+ \] side time 0 * to read the Bible *T*-1 and you work \[ and \+ and \] whatever , uh , that pretty well takes up your time for reading . E_S
16979:52	And \[ I , \+ I \] been praying that God would put a desire * to read the Bible in my heart E_S
17004:110	\[ And it , \+ and it 's \] kind of short because we \[ do n't , \+ \[ woe \+ \] do n't \] have a lot of time , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] read *T*-1 , E_S

17609:73	* Suppose *-1 to be much better if you find grass , uh , \[ or , \+ or \] dirt 0 * to jog on *T*-2 . E_S
17694:17	nice way 0 * to start off this spring *T*-1 .
17792:32	There was one guy 0 I use *-1 to watch *T*-2 on E S P N , E_S
18192:38	But that seems *-1 to be a good way 0 * to get off *T*-2 for a lot of them too . E_S
18355:119	\[ we ca n't , \+ we ca n't \] put in anything too big , um , as far as , uh , shrubs and things like that because they 've got *-1 to get a chance * to \[ find the , \+ find the \] cracks in the rock . E_S
18433:76	\[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it \] only has about five or six more years 0 * to go *T*-1 because \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] really old bush , E_S
18470:40	We have a plum that *T*-1 's just about ready *-2 to go , E_S
18753:40	and it brought it to its knees . Just in the ability * to handle . N_S
18772:51	Uh , what I 've gotten into *T*-1 more recently are the tools 0 *T*-2 to use them . E_S
18961:26	and there 's no way 0 * to get rid *-1 of them *T*-2 . E_S
18979:76	And it 's really going *-1 to be a mess when they have *-2 to start *-3 hunting for places 0 * to put the things *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
19042:31	But so few people , uh , have enough * to make that worthwhile
19183:41	The difficulty with that is that very few people have enough * to make it worthwhile . E_S
19209:69	and so \[ i- , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] a real difficult choice whether we want Styrofoam cups 0 * to fill up our landfills *T*-3 or , uh , china cups 0 * to use up our water *T*-2 . E_S
19392:73	But I do n't believe that he , in this first pass around , you know , *-3 being the first one 0 *T*-1 to really turn things around or attempt *-2 to *?* is going *-3 to be allowed *-4 to get away with it either . E_S
19437:86	it *EXP*-2 's easy * to believe that they were probably more *ICH*-4 forced *-3 into a pact than , uh , a volunteer or willingness * to join . E_S
19494:49	you know , that 's going *-1 to be the safest place 0 * to be *T*-2 . E_S
19785:26	if you ever get a chance * to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area \[ there where \+ there was , \] uh , some Texas , uh , groups *T*-1 E_S
20184:32	and I have n't taken the time or effort * to learn what they are *T*-1 . E_S
20529:30	So , That 's a good way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
20580:34	we could n't think of a better time 0 * to buy than now *T*-1 . E_S
20584:56	But , anyway . Well , um , I ca n't think of a whole lot more 0 * to say *T*-1 . E_S
20788:27	and there was nowhere else 0 * to take them *T*-1 E_S
20829:58	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ we just do n't \] have the room 0 * to store all that much *T*-1 , you know , E_S
20879:49	and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S
20969:41	Well , I do n't find a lot of time 0 * to watch T V *T*-1 . E_S
21068:42	But , I think 0 there 's enough out there 0 * to pick from *T*-1 . E_S
21484:88	\[ and \+ and , \] well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think 0 *T*-3 , is 0 they have a tendency *-2 to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities well , especially after they get married *-1 . E_S
21590:45	when you get married *-1 *T*-3 you 've got relationship 0 * to develop *T*-2 in the first place , E_S
21932:44	\[ would , \+ it would \] not have been a good idea * to had them then . E_S
22024:36	Like you do n't have any money 0 * \[ to , \+ to , \] get out *T*-1 . E_S
22024:44	Like you do n't have any money 0 * \[ to , \+ to , \] get out *T*-1 . E_S
22903:79	but I think 0 when the time comes *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] hope *-2 to have the time 0 * to really look around , you know and pick one that I really think 0 my mother would be happy at *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
23340:33	and then that 's just one more thing 0 * to have * to worry about *T*-1 . E_S
23362:34	and we just do n't have any place 0 * to store those kind of cans *T*-1 . E_S
23464:55	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a good way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
23519:29	They could be a good idea 0 * to , N_S
23985:174	And if you take , uh , little pieces of pork *ICH*-2 and you fry them , like little cubes of pork . And you fry them with garlic and a \[ little bit of , \+ couple dashes of \] hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry , just a little sherry 0 *T*-1 to thin it , and stir that in .
24274:104	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think , uh , 0 law would be \[ a fine field , \+ a fine profession , \] fine field 0 * to go into *T*-1 . E_S
24462:98	\[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I think , \] \+ I think \] 0 there 's a lot 0 *T*-1 to be said *-2 for kids working after school . E_S
24528:34	I think 0 it 's kind of a push * to , uh , weed out drugs in states E_S
24578:69	and from that point on , uh , \[ at , \+ \] the N C double A does have something 0 * to do *T*-1 with it , E_S
24588:100	. You know , as like a manager or supervisor thinks *RNR*-2 or has suspicion *RNR*-2 that someone is using drugs , E_S do you think 0 they should have the right * to send them *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S
24889:31	So , it 's got a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with economics in the area that you come from *T*-2 . E_S
25006:27	you are n't given *-1 the chance * to , you know , screw off all the time . E_S
25150:72	\[ Or , \+ or \] * even have had \[ the ability , \+ you know , the chance \] * \[ to , \+ to \] go to college or \[ \[ to , \+ to \] \+ to \] learn about , N_S

25180:73	I mean if you look at the average family it 's , like , man , they barely have time 0 * to stop and get gas , much less * to try and figure out how much gas they 're really getting *T*-1 and do all this *T*-2 . E_S
25653:60	now I 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else 0 * to play with *T*-1 , E_S
25737:25	* give her something 0 * to do *T*-1 that we both enjoy *T*-2 , N_S
26172:46	it used *-1 to be 0 Service Merchandise was the place 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
26174:26	and that was the place 0 * to go *T*-1 *-2 to get your T V -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that . E_S
26305:110	but , uh , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] trying *-1 to get a , uh , intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area 0 *-2 to do my dissertation in *T*-3 . E_S
26309:38	It *EXP*-3 's hard * finding an area 0 *-1 to do a dissertation *T*-2 in this field . E_S
26487:74	and if I were *-1 to get married *-2 and have a family that would have *-3 to have something 0 * to do *T*-4 with it . E_S
26650:49	or maybe * offer them , you know , some sort of an incentive * to do it . Uh , you know college credit , you know , something , you know , E_S
27094:54	they 've been a big drive *ICH*-1 \[ in , \+ especially in \] the seventies * to return back to the basics . E_S
27816:88	And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ pretty , \+ fairly \] well easily \[ to \+ uh , uh , something 0 * to \] fall into *T*-1 . E_S
27939:40	in fact , uh , one of my favorite things 0 * to do *T*-1 now is * sit down and listen to Chopin , that *T*-2 is played *-3 on , uh , piano . E_S
27940:107	\[ I just , \+ you know , I can just \] drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time 0 * to do that *T*-2 , E_S
27952:25	* Just never got a chance * to come out . E_S
27997:60	\[ There was not , \+ there 's not \] supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *T*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *T*-3 on any given day *T*-4 . E_S
28093:28	And I wanted something else 0 * to do *T*-1 , E_S
28100:56	but as they get older and they 're more independent , and there 's things 0 * to do *T*-1 , then it *EXP*-2 's good for them to go to different , N_S
28139:175	Because \[ if , \+ if \] I had been allowed *-1 to work , you know , maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week , I might still be working basically full time or part time , \[ if there was , \+ if there had been \] some way 0 *-3 to work it out *T*-2 , E_S
28235:31	and that 's a very hard attitude 0 * to change *T*-1 . E_S
28329:56	and I felt like when they were young *T*-1 , that was the time 0 *-2 to instill it *T*-5 . That \[ it could be , \+ it could be \] added to *-3 and strengthened *-3 as they grew older , but 0 when they were little *T*-4 , you know , N_S
28663:31	And , uh , * wait for an opportunity * to use it . E_S
28803:63	I think 0 they feel 0 this is going *-1 to be an effortless sweatless way , 0 * to get in shape , without * having *-3 to spend anything *T*-2 E_S
29395:97	Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S
29402:54	but these guys had \[ a , \+ a , \] uh , national soap box 0 * to stand on *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] express this view . E_S
29547:24	It 's piddly stuff 0 * to pick a newspaper over *T*-1 , E_S
29887:51	It \[ is not , \+ does not \] sound like an easy one 0 * to finish *T*-1 . E_S
29902:38	it just seems like there 's just never enough time * to pick it up and do it , E_S you know ,
30380:47	You know , she always seems *-3 to have better things 0 *-4 to do *T*-1 than *-4 to try *-5 to sit down and figure out how * to use her computer *T*-2 you know . E_S
30483:40	So I can see where it would be a great advantage * to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school *T*-1 . E_S
30532:48	I mean , E_S and then of course you have some changes 0 * to make *T*-1 , and do the whole thing over . E_S
30753:34	It was just mostly centered *-1 upon his abilities * to N_S
30927:27	I do n't have time 0 *-1 to read the book *T*-2 . E_S
31128:27	and I was never one 0 *T*-2 to believe everything 0 my kids said *T*-1 , you know , about something . E_S
31131:62	But , uh , still \[ I , \+ I \] questioned the ability of some of the teachers * to , uh , really do a bang-up job , E_S
31136:235	It *EXP*-2 was told *-1 to me or suggested *-1 to me , uh , that * to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas , E_S and I think 0 it 's similar \[ in , \+ in \] many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of , uh , people 0 *T*-1 to teach math and sciences . E_S
31318:42	You would have expected them to be the last ones 0 *T*-1 to *?* . E_S
31413:44	But it *EXP*-2 seems to me that there are ways 0 * to accommodate that *T*-1 . Um , E_S
31427:62	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S
31705:79	I guess 0 as far north as you are *?* if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months 0 * to go *T*-1 , have n't you *?* ? E_S
31959:56	You know , \[ they 've , \+ they 've \] got twelve weeks 0 * to do something *T*-1 , E_S
32045:36	and , uh , when you have time 0 * to do it *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
32211:21	there 's not enough room * to plant . Some of those things like , uh , you know , the things that *T*-2 vine like , uh , cucumbers , or , uh , squash or something , like that . Plant one of those E_S
33015:37	That 's one of my favorite things 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] serve *T*-1 . E_S
33015:45	That 's one of my favorite things 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] serve *T*-1 . E_S
33084:50	but \[ there 's , \+ uh , they 're \] a pain 0 * to peel *T*-1 for some people . E_S
33938:42	I need * to go actually *-1 get something 0 * to eat *T*-2 here . E_S
33957:64	but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right * to do that . E_S
33993:100	* takes two weeks for that system to process , uh , your request \[ for , \+ \] uh , not as a gun permit \[ but , \+ uh , but \] * to buy ammunition . E_S
34039:44	In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day . E_S
34103:41	and , uh , we ca n't even find a place 0 * to shoot *T*-1 . Just for target practice . E_S
34189:44	\[ I- , \+ is n't \] there a way 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] deregister yourself after you register a gun *T*-1 ? E_S
34189:57	\[ I- , \+ is n't \] there a way 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] deregister yourself after you register a gun *T*-1 ? E_S
34790:26	She was the only indian 0 *T*-1 to have her hair done at all times . E_S
34914:37	Well I have n't had too much of a chance * to watch T V lately . E_S
35868:26	and he did n't have a chance *-1 to , uh , you know , N_S
35886:87	and \[ after , \+ after \] *-1 wasting the first six years , *-1 partying and everything else , I decided , uh-huh , time 0 * to settle down and do something *T*-2 . E_S
35921:121	I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required *-1 to spend \[ at least part of their time , \+ not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity * to look for a job , but at least some of their time \] \[ * to look for , \+ *-2 to go out \] and clean up the roads . You know , E_S
36106:71	and you see , you know , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money 0 * to go down and play video games all night *T*-1 , you know E_S
36147:46	And \[ when , \+ uh , when \] come time 0 * to get out of school *T*-3 *T*-2 , I thought , Boy , I 'd like *-4 to teach . E_S
36156:51	I mean , \[ that , \+ that 's \] a sad thing 0 * to think *T*-1 , E_S
36353:47	\[ And , \+ um , and \] that 's my favorite way 0 * to exercise *T*-1 . E_S
36440:51	So it 's a little harder when you 're depending on other people 0 *T*-3 to do it with you *T*-2 because you have *-1 to meet their schedules as well , E_S
36929:63	Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S
37026:58	What *T*-1 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources 0 * to grow and produce their food *T*-2 , E_S but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way 0 it should *?* *T*-1 . E_S
37277:26	it 's a way 0 for me to stay home *T*-1 . E_S
37286:9	* to have my cake and eat it too , kind of thing . E_S
37386:41	see \[ I have , \+ I have \] a tendency * to , \[ a , \+ adopt \] teams when I \[ \[ wen- , \+ go to a tea- , \] \+ uh , go to a town *T*-1 . \] E_S
37426:33	they do n't have the offense 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get out , or to have \[ the , \+ the \] more runs *T*-1 , E_S
37426:47	they do n't have the offense 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get out , or to have \[ the , \+ the \] more runs *T*-1 , E_S
37456:101	I mean , uh , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] a player ought *-1 to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch 0 * to do it *T*-2 , E_S
37504:134	\[ you , \+ you 've \] got *-1 to be able *-2 to get the two and three run home runs , you know , *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] be able *-3 to , uh , score enough runs * to be able *-4 to win \[ in these , \+ uh , in this \] day and age , E_S
37731:53	I always thought that teachers never got paid *-1 nearly enough , I mean , * to be doing what they 're doing *T*-2 , uh . E_S
37766:115	what *T*-1 gets me is 0 I ca n't believe that \[ Congress , \+ uh , or , our state legislature \] ca n't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means 0 * to have funds for the school *T*-2 . E_S
38247:26	but it 's a lot 0 * to put *T*-1 into one . E_S
38546:28	but that has a little bit 0 *T*-1 to do with some of the things that I read *T*-2 . E_S
38610:39	but I never seem *-1 to have the time 0 *-2 to do that kind of reading *T*-3 . E_S
38706:34	and right now , my list of books 0 *T*-1 to be read *-2 have *-3 to do with , uh , the art of selling . E_S
38824:58	I would love *-2 to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time 0 * to do it *T*-3 or if I had the space . E_S
38866:15	Things 0 * to hang *T*-1 on the wall . E_S
38898:30	it 's just getting the time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
38941:28	it was just too much 0 * to start with *T*-1 . E_S
38951:47	\[ and , \+ and , \] it was just too much 0 * to begin with *T*-1 . E_S And I think kind of discouraged me from *-2 doing much more with it . E_S
39693:27	it just takes the time 0 * to cut everything up *T*-1 . E_S
39707:30	So that we can have those 0 * to enjoy *T*-1 . E_S
39848:46	I mean , of course , this year is a good year 0 * to be \[ a , \+ a \] Chicago \[ B- , \+ \] fan *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 , because they 're doing pretty good . E_S
39953:63	\[ \[ and that , \+ and that , \] \+ so that 's \] a terrible time 0 * to have *-1 to deal with that *T*-2 , \[ right in , \+ \] \[ when it , \+ when it \] counts so much *T*-3 . E_S
40121:45	nobody 's got enough beef , I guess 0 *T*-4 , 0 *-1 to challenge him \[ when he 's , \+ when he 's \] driving hard to the hoop *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
40672:40	we all need that time , just some quiet time 0 *-1 to wind down from the day *T*-2 . E_S
40792:65	and \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] one of those that *T*-1 's very hard 0 * to get into *T*-2 . E_S
40938:27	They would n't have anything 0 *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S
40950:29	this is a really neat thing 0 * to do *T*-1 *ICH*-3 too , that they did *T*-2 , E_S
41029:28	But , uh , he has enough relatives * to make up for me not having any . E_S
41171:40	like , say about the same distance for all of you all to come ? E_S
41662:144	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] when we are doing wardrobing *T*-1 and we have , uh , \[ two , \+ two \] hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes 0 * to wear *T*-2 on the job . E_S
42591:60	and , \[ I guess \+ I think , \] 0 the other thing that we ought *-2 to control *T*-1 to some extent is , 0 there should be some law against the types of gu- , N_S
42820:62	She knows real well \[ about , \+ uh , about \] her Daddy 's guns , what * not to do *T*-2 and what * to do *T*-1 around them . E_S
42856:18	not something 0 * to be curious about *T*-1 and not something 0 * to be totally scared about *T*-2 . E_S
42877:24	and it 's something 0 * to think about *T*-1 , E_S
43146:59	Uh , I found one thing that , *T*-1 it 's kind of a weird thing 0 * to say * to put *T*-2 out on the lawn , E_S
43556:52	But there 's \[ no , \+ you know , nothing \] else 0 *T*-1 to keep it going . E_S
43690:26	If I ever get the hankering *-1 to see something , I 've got , I do n't know , maybe about thirty or forty movies E_S
43852:46	Uh , but other than that I just did n't have time 0 * to go to the movies *T*-1 , you know . E_S
43934:50	I 'm in the middle of , um , *-1 going out for bids * to have my house painted *-2 . E_S
43953:52	is easy * to find \[ pa- , \+ uh , painters \] 0 *T*-1 to do this for you ? E_S
44088:38	So we still have some of that trim work 0 * to do *T*-1 because we put it off all this time , E_S
44209:41	I think 0 that has a lot of things 0 *T*-1 to did with , uh , um , N_S
44286:42	sometimes I think 0 *T*-1 a religion has a lot 0 *T*-2 to do with that . E_S
44344:59	So , um , \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 that has something 0 *T*-1 to do with why Latinos \[ or , \+ \] tend *-2 to be , you know , \[ the mee- , \+ the more meek *T*-3 , \] you know , E_S
44367:32	I think 0 it has something 0 *T*-1 to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic , uh , country , E_S
44400:47	you know , I think 0 communication does have a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it , you know , in education , maybe . E_S
44409:64	I think 0 it maybe has \[ * to do with a lo- , \+ a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with \] education E_S
44475:146	\[ So , \+ you know , and \] \[ yet they , \+ yet people \] get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in *RNR*-4 and the Russians moving in *RNR*-4 certain areas of technology , you know , that we use *-1 to dominate *T*-3 *T*-2 E_S
45044:26	But they have the money 0 * to be able *-1 to do it *T*-2 . E_S
45150:39	Well , \[ just the , \+ just the \] opportunity * to try the voting machines , E_S
45419:44	\[ but , \+ but \] they were neat , enjoyable animals 0 * to have *T*-1 . E_S
45535:62	and now , it *EXP*-3 's like a major production , * trying *-2 to find somebody 0 *T*-1 to take care of the dog while you 're gone . E_S
47147:36	so , that 's probably a pretty nice place 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
47211:62	But , um , \[ it 's a real , \+ it 's a real \] nice place 0 * to go and camp *T*-1 , E_S
47291:68	I \[ do n't know , \+ do n't know \] when I 'm going *-1 to get a chance *-2 to do that *T*-3 E_S
47650:46	that 's one of the , um , entrances to the periphery 0 * to get in and out of the city *T*-1 . E_S
47764:45	and so this book it just really MUMBLEx all these things and how * to train the child *T*-1 E_S
47869:53	\[ it , \+ it \] just seems like there was always something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
47895:26	and then it was time for them to go to bed . E_S
49834:102	and \[ when they , \+ when they \] drafted somebody *T*-1 and he did n't work out at that spot *T*-1 it really was n't a good enough athlete 0 * to move *T*-2 to any place else . E_S
49898:34	and every once in a while * gets a chance * to talk to some of the guys E_S
50178:22	It has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with us . E_S
50227:31	it 's a very opportune moment 0 for them to try *T*-1 . E_S
50752:181	Well , I think that \[ in the , \+ in the \] cases \[ that , \+ like that , \] uh , they had *-1 to be , uh , pretty thoroughly examined *-2 *-1 to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth , and that this was n't something new 0 *T*-3 just to keep out of * going to war . E_S
50876:47	It 's probably \[ a , \+ a \] very good way 0 * to keep them off the streets and out of trouble *T*-1 , E_S
50922:30	It was just as a demonstration 0 *T*-1 to show those who *T*-2 were watching it how easily obtainable information *ICH*-3 is *T*-4 on any single person . E_S
51001:22	There 's nothing 0 *T*-1 to block anything . E_S
51753:26	and , it 's time 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
51773:34	and a lot of parents have places 0 * to go *T*-1 \[ and \+ and \] things like that . E_S
52149:36	So it 'd probably be a good thing 0 for me to see *T*-1 .
52183:25	I just gave away just enough * to get you interested . E_S
52493:84	and \[ if , \+ if \] and when he \[ comes , \+ \] gets free again *T*-1 , he will have no compunction but *-2 to \[ complete \[ that , \+ that \] same kind of lifestyle , \+ I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle , \] and perhaps do the same thing again . E_S
52837:54	and they have *-1 to use sticks and rocks and stuff like , that 0 *-2 to play with *T*-3 . E_S
52848:77	\[ it 's \+ really \[ is a , \+ is a \] \] \[ good , \+ good \] family thing , 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
52990:36	I know 0 there are some good places 0 * to go *-2 camping *T*-1 along \[ the , \+ uh , the \] lakes . E_S
53404:52	Oh , I do n't even have , \[ ge- , \+ \] time 0 *-1 to read the newspaper except in *-2 passing *T*-3 , N_S
53496:42	I would think 0 they could find a better way 0 * to fund it *T*-1 though , E_S
53596:33	I do n't really have much more 0 *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
53831:39	I think 0 that is a very wrong way 0 * to handle , uh , *-1 disciplining a child *T*-2 . E_S
53839:55	I think 0 \[ that is , \+ that 's \] not the way 0 * to \[ handle a child , \+ you know , discipline a child *T*-1 \] by * putting him in a closet . E_S
54335:52	and it *EXP*-1 's too bad that he just did n't have the ability * just to do it , \[ to \+ \] you know , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] go ahead * to do it . E_S
54563:53	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] on our list of things 0 * to see *T*-1 . E_S

55070:64	\[ It 's . \+ It 's \] been \[ a rough tow , \+ a rough road 0 * to hoe *T*-1 \] ever since he left . E_S
55147:46	\[ That , \+ that \] sure was a fun Super Bowl 0 * to watch *T*-1 this year . E_S
55266:25	they are nothing nice 0 * to go up against *T*-1 . E_S
55714:22	they have nothing 0 *-2 to do *T*-1 with that . E_S
55721:41	and they show you \[ how , \+ everything 0 * to do *T*-1 , and how \] * to do it *T*-3 , and the whole nine yards . E_S
55766:39	But that 's because of my physical condition and nothing 0 *T*-1 to do what they did *T*-2 . E_S
55897:33	Uh , and I find ways 0 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] turn some of that back \[ to , \+ to \] others *T*-2 . E_S
55897:41	Uh , and I find ways 0 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] turn some of that back \[ to , \+ to \] others *T*-2 . E_S
55898:87	Uh , and \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't see that as *-1 being something 0 * to really object to *T*-2 . E_S
55938:27	And this would give them a chance *-1 to have some positive self-esteem . E_S
56120:35	Of course , that 's probably blasphemy 0 for you to say *T*-3 , uh , *-2 coming from where you are *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
56139:74	Uh , or we 'll suddenly be in the dark and say , Oh , my goodness , now we do n't have the ability * to go on to some new technology . E_S
56823:115	you know , \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] why we hire people \[ who , \+ \] uh , you know , 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] make these decisions for us *T*-2 . E_S

56829:35	I wish 0 we were given *-1 an opportunity * to vote on more things . E_S
56881:30	I mean here you have the right * to vote E_S
56883:72	You know , \[ we have , \+ just as we have \] \[ a r- , \+ a duty \] * to pay taxes , you know , E_S
56885:34	I mean , we do n't have the right * to pay taxes in this country , E_S
56886:19	we have the duty * to pay taxes . E_S
56923:52	I told them 0 if they do n't vote they do n't have the right * to criticize . E_S

57130:36	you know , that 's a good way 0 * to approach it *T*-1 . E_S
57330:21	Just a little shell 0 *T*-1 to go under a suit , you know . E_S
57363:26	That 's the best way 0 * to shop *T*-1 . E_S
57395:37	So \[ that , \+ that \] has a lot * to do with it . E_S
57565:33	so I found a outfit down here 0 *T*-1 to rebuild it . And , uh , \[ i- , \+ \] reinstalled that E_S
57663:22	but they had enough power * t- , pull all this weight . E_S
57687:74	and it 's fairly easy 0 * to work with *T*-1 because there 's not just a whole lot in it 0 *T*-2 to go wrong ,
58151:24	* Giving a soapbox 0 * to stand on *T*-1 . E_S
58295:42	I guess , 0 my feeling is 0 the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * to just start *-2 giving weights , you know , have a very brief transition period and then just start *-3 giving weights and kilometers , er , just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and , uh , just have people start *-4 using it rather than having people constantly trying *-5 to convert . E_S
58365:30	and after all , the whole reason 0 * to go over to metric *T*-1 is * to have round numbers ,
59221:60	and , really , if you do n't want the kids , then it 's not the time 0 * to have , N_S
59408:80	If they \[ want , \+ want \] me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I 've got his permission * to have an automatic weapon in his county , that 's fine too . E_S
59470:63	but , uh , I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do , use it safely *T*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *T*-1 , if not more so . E_S
59691:50	the jury , you know , decided , hey , it 's time 0 * to crackdown here *T*-1 , you know , E_S
59692:24	and it was time 0 * to do this drug thing *T*-1 E_S

62088:26	It 's not a program 0 *T*-1 to teach them *-2 to use the American money ,
62089:24	it 's a program 0 *T*-3 to teach them *-4 to be more self-reliant . E_S
62493:48	I think , uh , uh , 0 there 's a lot 0 *T*-2 not to be said *-1 for credit E_S
62494:27	but that 's one thing 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1 for credit . E_S \[ It , \+ how , it \] gets you some muscle where you need it *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
62558:67	so after that then \[ you could n't get a \+ , you could n't get a \] tape 0 * to play *T*-1 at the right speed in that side . E_S
62706:28	There is n't , any way 0 * to get paid *-1 enough *T*-2 . E_S
62813:46	It *EXP*-1 's always easy * to find an excuse 0 * not to exercise *T*-2 . E_S
62922:39	that makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3 . E_S
63165:35	For me , I would n't have time 0 * to do an \[ hour , \+ hour \] of aerobics and then take a shower and \[ get , \+ get \] dressed *-1 again *T*-2 . E_S
63349:53	It 's just time I think 0 *T*-1 \[ for , \+ for \] us to go over . E_S
63765:86	you know , and , for the environment \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] a good reason 0 * to do it *T*-1 , E_S
63797:29	You have *-1 to get enough nerve * to ask somebody *-2 to take something off the top shelf . E_S
63798:24	You have n't got enough nerve * to say well , * put it back , E_S
63848:23	And just anything , 0 * to , you know , recycle *T*-1 rather than keep *-2 throwing *T*-1 it away , E_S
63849:60	but my biggest problem is , 0 I take the bags out of the store , buy the bags * to bring the back , E_S
63977:62	if they 're going *-1 to go out of state for vacation that 's the time 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
64151:27	I do n't have anything 0 * to worry about *T*-1 . E_S
65089:47	and so during the school year , I just do n't have time 0 * to read *T*-1 . E_S
65104:56	And , uh , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have time 0 * to read *T*-1 in , N_S
65500:110	So \[ we 're going *-4 to , \+ they 're going *-1 to \] stay there . Which *T*-2 is fine , because Arlington 's got a lot of things 0 * to offer *T*-3 . E_S
65532:37	And I think 0 Dallas has enough *ICH*-3 0 * to offer *T*-1 that they do n't have *-2 to hog everything . E_S
65757:152	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S
65758:63	Obviously , \[ there 's , \+ uh , you know , there 's \] a lot 0 * to learn *T*-1 , uh , after that . E_S
65847:26	And they have so much 0 *-2 to spend *T*-1 E_S
65848:28	and there 's not enough money 0 * to spread *T*-1 around . E_S
66032:64	So , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] kind of a bad time 0 * to be a slave to your credit cards *T*-1 . E_S
66195:18	And one 0 * to watch out for *T*-1 is anybody that *T*-2 bills you out of \[ Atlanta , \+ Atlanta , \] Georgia . E_S
66360:94	I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , I mean pretty soon you run out of people 0 * to murder *T*-1 . E_S
66578:44	\[ It 's , \+ there 's \] always something 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
67026:37	And then another half an hour , you know 0 * to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff *T*-1 . E_S
67031:34	Uh , and then of course another hour 0 * to get back home *T*-1 . E_S
67840:48	\[ but , \+ uh , uh , but \] there is something 0 *T*-1 to be said *-2 about , N_S
67885:86	It *EXP*-1 's easier * to say it on the telephone E_S and everyone agree that , yeah , the death penalty 's the way 0 * to go *T*-2 , E_S
67901:89	Uh , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , that 's \] an awful lot 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] expect *T*-1 of a person ,
67901:102	Uh , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , that 's \] an awful lot 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] expect *T*-1 of a person ,
67912:52	Or rather than * have a warped mind it was just the only way 0 * to get whatever they wanted *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
67934:38	I think 0 our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance . E_S
68262:26	You are a good one 0 *T*-1 to talk about consumer goods , because you keep up on it all the time . E_S
68270:47	Well , uh , I do n't have strong feelings about changes 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 in the , uh , jury system , do you ? E_S
68375:91	I definitely feel like we need *-1 to keep it at least unanimous E_S because , uh , you know , there 's the classic sort of * TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get , you know , jury which *T*-2 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that , a judge at least officially is n't supposed *-3 to have *T*-4 . Though , of course they can *?* , too *T*-5 . E_S
68375:92	I definitely feel like we need *-1 to keep it at least unanimous E_S because , uh , you know , there 's the classic sort of * TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get , you know , jury which *T*-2 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that , a judge at least officially is n't supposed *-3 to have *T*-4 .

68637:44	Um , of course , we keep *-2 picking crummy weather 0 * to go out there *T*-1 , E_S
68689:41	But it 's \[ a \+ \] pretty neat down 0 * to just go *T*-2 and walk around *T*-2 , if you like *-1 to walk , E_S
68690:26	it 's a good town 0 * to just , walk in *T*-1 . E_S
68707:26	it 's a good town 0 * to wander in *T*-1 . E_S
68750:26	and I really have no great urge * to go back now . E_S
68799:29	Charleston is a really nice place 0 * to visit *T*-1 . E_S
68813:86	one of these days we 'll get down there , although . I do n't know when we 're going *-1 to have vacation 0 * to do it *T*-3 *T*-2 . E_S
69099:50	Well , I guess 0 it depends on if you got something 0 *-2 to worry about *T*-1 . E_S
69161:100	and , so , I really do n't care one way or another if anybody wants *-1 to pull me up tomorrow and test me . Because I have nothing 0 * to worry about *T*-2 . E_S
69236:85	If you do test *-1 positive for something they will give you an \[ \[ op- , \+ o- , \] \+ opportunity \] 0 * to go *-3 get your life straight rather than to lose your job *T*-2 . E_S
69549:41	and do you think 0 you 'll have a baby 0 * to take *T*-1 back with you . E_S
69676:28	It 's a big area 0 for people to come *T*-1 from the different , uh , countries , mostly like Japan , Germany and England . E_S
69850:21	but it was n't enough * to offset what they lost *T*-1 over the last four years . E_S
69870:74	but , um , they turn to golden dead grass , for the majority of the Summer just because there is no water 0 *T*-1 to keep them green . E_S
70197:34	you have * to , the yard 0 * to deal with *T*-1 E_S
70248:49	And \[ that was really , \+ that was \] a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline E_S
70535:36	Did you have a special program on your computer 0 * to do that *T*-1 E_S
70579:34	but at least we 've got a place 0 * to live *T*-1 . E_S
70676:32	so , that 's not a good way 0 * to , N_S
70870:48	but , they forgot *-1 to put in the state budget the money 0 *T*-2 to pay for it , E_S
70894:142	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I have , \+ I have \] no problem , with , uh , a certain , uh , \[ floor level , \+ minimum level , \] that *T*-3 's a standard uh , that everybody , uh , ought *-1 to be able *-1 to have *T*-2 ,
70899:46	but , I am opposed to , \[ w- , \+ \] any attempts * to restrict , um , local communities from *-2 taxing themselves above that *-1 to provide above the minimum . E_S
71089:25	it has really nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with , uh , actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that , E_S
71186:94	so I 've discovered that , uh , impatiens that tried and true *ICH*-3 \[ is , \+ \] turns out *-2 to be about the best thing 0 * to use *T*-1 there along with coleus . Because they , uh , look pretty \[ and , \+ \] in my front garden , uh , E_S
71406:49	Well , I hope 0 you have \[ a , \+ an \] opportunity * to garden again . E_S
71774:74	to me that was just too much of a hassle * to get all geared *-1 up and take the time 0 *-1 to drive over there , and workout and then drive back *T*-2 . E_S
72003:73	Huh . Well , I guess 0 that 's good that \[ they , \+ they 've \] got something 0 *T*-1 to keep them active . E_S
72058:51	so . If there was some way \[ for , \+ for \] women \[ to , \+ to \] stay home even if they could work *T*-1 , you know , E_S
72058:59	so . If there was some way \[ for , \+ for \] women \[ to , \+ to \] stay home even if they could work *T*-1 , you know , E_S
72284:91	I let \[ papers , \+ newspapers \] stack * up and magazines stack * up , if I do n't really set aside a time 0 * to look or read them *T*-1 . E_S
72343:51	and then before you know \[ it , \+ it 's \] time 0 * to get up and go to work *T*-1 . E_S
72442:79	If someone says , do you want *-2 to do this tonight , uh , and I got a mountain of things 0 * to do *T*-1 , it 's okay , you know ,
72811:49	So , they 've got quite a bit more motivation I think 0 *T*-3 * to get paid *-2 then , some of the others do . E_S
72906:26	It 's just another way 0 * to make money *T*-1 , as far as I can tell . E_S
73049:95	So , um , I can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
73059:60	\[ It 's , \+ uh , you know , it 's \] a terrible thing 0 * to say *T*-2 when you 're speaking of children in that way *T*-1 , E_S
73189:64	since they 're both in school , you do n't have *-1 to worry about a full-time person 0 *T*-2 to take care of them . E_S
73342:75	She never had *-1 to worry about *-3 taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older 0 *T*-2 to deal with them , E_S
73442:76	you know , uh , as you 're talking like police and stuff like that it 's definitely a tough job 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
73451:29	and maybe that has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with it . E_S
73478:44	I think 0 there 's more pressure *ICH*-2 like on both parents * to work , and things like that than there used *-1 to be *?* E_S
73700:27	I just have n't had a chance * to get back . E_S
73711:55	I think 0 we ran out of \[ social , \+ social \] changes 0 * to talk about *T*-1 , E_S
73883:116	if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S
74232:34	I 've got a lot of things 0 *T*-1 to keep me busy . E_S
74261:33	And if there was a way 0 * \[ to , \+ \] through the public mind , set that image to be a little higher esteem , \[ a little , \+ uh , uh , a little \] more prestige to * being a teacher *T*-1 . N_S
74280:39	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74306:24	Uh , just something 0 *T*-1 to , i- , N_S
74326:29	So there really was no time 0 * to try , much of anything and get significant feedback that *T*-1 would help \[ the , \+ the \] student teacher improve very much *T*-2 . E_S
74583:55	I figured 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to hire somebody 0 *T*-3 to remove our windows and put new ones *ICH*-6 in that *T*-4 are easier 0 * to clean *T*-5 . E_S
74989:42	Uh , I think 0 T V has a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with the changes , too . Do n't you ?
75642:29	Uh , there 's no reason 0 * to enforce those and spend time and money *-2 doing it \[ and , \+ and \] worry about these things *T*-1 where people are getting hurt *-4 *T*-5 . E_S
75732:128	so I feel sort of , uh , you know , like it *EXP*-5 's sort of defeating my purpose *-1 to go *-2 rip everything out now and do it over just because I 'm in the mood 0 *-3 to do it *T*-4 . E_S
76104:41	and I thought 0 that would be the hardest thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
76132:37	I 'm going *-1 to find a house 0 *-2 to put that door on *T*-3 before she does . E_S
76298:41	and they proved out late when it came time 0 * to take the S A T -s *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
76392:60	and basically \[ he , \+ his \] answer was , Oh , I gave him permission * \[ to , \+ to \] miss . E_S
76392:68	and basically \[ he , \+ his \] answer was , Oh , I gave him permission * \[ to , \+ to \] miss . E_S
76978:74	\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] really \[ hard , \+ hard \] * to find time 0 *-5 to spend *T*-2 together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that *T*-3 are different *T*-4 . E_S
77127:26	that 's a good way 0 * to put it *T*-1 . E_S
77132:29	that 's a pretty good way 0 * to put it *T*-1 . E_S
77525:44	you do n't have the families , 0 *T*-1 \[ too , \+ to \] take up the gap . E_S
77640:55	and that is the trend in a lot of , uh , lower class areas , for the grandmothers to be raising the children . E_S
77694:36	and I find 0 I have no patience 0 * to really read a newspaper *T*-1 because \[ I just , \+ \] I 'm reading so much all the time . E_S
77702:64	Uh , \[ I d- , \+ I just do n't \] seem *-1 to have time 0 * to sit down and read the paper *T*-2 . E_S Either N_S
77783:132	um , I 've found that \] when \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have cable television anymore , uh , when I moved , went back to graduate school *T*-2 I just did n't have the money 0 * to \[ buy , ge- , \+ rent \] a cable T V line , or whatever *T*-1 , you know . E_S
78211:63	but \[ we , \+ we \] never have really planned a vacation around , uh , places 0 * to go hiking *T*-1 . E_S

78358:48	There are a lot of \[ neat , \+ neat \] places 0 * to visit *T*-1 in America , E_S

78570:47	well , \[ it , \+ uh , they \] said something 0 *T*-2 to improve voting . E_S
78840:57	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that does n't really have that much 0 *T*-1 to do with , um , unless they 've done something really horrible , you know , or something real abnormal . E_S

79502:36	and , uh , he 's got a way 0 * to get in *T*-1 , E_S
79633:39	They 're really looking for a lot more men 0 *T*-1 to participate . E_S
79742:34	plus the fact that it *EXP*-1 's helpful * not to have *-2 to carry a lot of money sometimes . E_S
79941:80	And there 's some days 0 \[ it 's just \+ like it *EXP*-2 's \] the hardest thing in the world * \[ to , \+ to \] get started *-1 *T*-3 . E_S

80055:95	and now I work out at home , because \[ I do n't really , \+ my schedule with school and work , I do n't \] have time 0 *-2 to get down to one *T*-1 . E_S
80072:35	I 've got *-1 to have somebody 0 * to compete with *T*-2 , E_S
80227:24	At least you got a chance * to out run them that way . E_S
80319:54	And I 've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *T*-2 . E_S
80320:58	And I 'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them . Either that or * maybe rag rolling . To give it kind of a country look . E_S
80477:87	and he said 0 it *ICH*-2 's a good thing 0 I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something 0 * to drink *T*-1 and went in there I would think 0 I was having hallucinations . E_S
80563:37	and I decided 0 that was too much 0 * to tackle *T*-1 , E_S
80791:108	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I , \] \+ I \] agree with you that the problem seems *-1 to be 0 they do n't have enough time 0 * to do all the stuff *T*-2 . E_S
81571:22	oh , there 's enough * to put , oh , I 'd say , uh , \[ what , \+ \] twelve feet between each house on each side . E_S
81600:34	and you 've got plenty of room 0 * to even play a small game of baseball *T*-1 ,
82275:195	so \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] real easy * to work out my schedule , you know , *-3 \[ \[ to , uh , get in , \+ to , \] \+ to still stay in \] with that , \[ an , \+ and \] to have enough time 0 * to spend *T*-1 with Matthew . E_S
82777:76	\[ i- , \+ if \] it *EXP*-2 is difficult * to register *-1 to vote , that would remove your eligibility * to vote . E_S
82874:134	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] solution \[ to , \+ to \] part of this \[ is , \+ is \] * \[ to , \+ to \] make it \[ a-a-an , \+ an \] economic incentive for people to vote . E_S
83004:213	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ before these enormous , \+ before this \] Voting Rights Act , what we had *T*-1 was \[ a , \+ a \] great deal of our population , uh , mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded *-2 \[ by , \+ by , \] uh , voting laws , uh , \[ from * reg- , \+ from their eligibility * to register . \] E_S
83031:63	But \[ is n't that , \+ is n't that \] kind of a blanket racist kind of thing 0 * to say *T*-1 the blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just do n't vote ? E_S
83058:32	and there still was n't enough minority vote * \[ to get , \+ to pass \] the plan that they were backing *T*-1 . E_S
83187:32	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 .

83234:32	Anyway , the deterrent . For people \[ \[ to , \+ to \] commit the cri- , \+ uh , to not to commit the crime \] is sort of gone away . E_S
83234:40	Anyway , the deterrent . For people \[ \[ to , \+ to \] commit the cri- , \+ uh , to not to commit the crime \] is sort of gone away . E_S
83281:72	I imagine 0 there is a \[ certain , \+ certain \] right *ICH*-1 of the press * to have the ability * to ask that . E_S
83548:57	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , somehow or another they 'll give you an option * to leave a message E_S

84047:20	The other thing 0 * to do *T*-1 if you , \[ re- , \+ really \] like the hyacinths , and I do , is that before you plant those bulbs , * stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so * to cool them . E_S
84149:27	That is , uh , probably enough * to see . E_S
84423:24	That is the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
84459:33	That is a very , very neat town 0 * to visit *T*-1 . Uh , in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things 0 you hear about *T*-2 . E_S
84626:24	That is a way 0 * to put it *T*-1 , E_S
84788:56	And even now with my grandchildren , I feel 0 it 's a very important thing 0 *T*-1 to be done *-2 . E_S
84821:40	And the wife says , Well , you need something 0 * to do *T*-1 , E_S
85086:47	But with the pollution issue , uh , fossil fuel is not the way 0 * to go *T*-1 anyway . E_S
85295:26	it 's a good time 0 * to buy *T*-1 , if you 're in the market . E_S
85377:59	But \[ you , \+ you \] have *-1 to know the right spot , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] pick *T*-3 where that does n't happen *T*-2 . E_S
85377:67	But \[ you , \+ you \] have *-1 to know the right spot , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] pick *T*-3 where that does n't happen *T*-2 . E_S
85582:100	And also , um , you know , the other thing is 0 \[ their idea , \+ or our \[ ide- , \+ idea \] \] of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with them . E_S
85591:54	\[ i- , \+ I \] do n't think that that 's the way 0 * to go *T*-1 in this E_S
85677:27	Well it has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with their religion . E_S
86041:74	And \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ actually it 's \] a fairly common vacation place 0 for French people to go *T*-1 E_S

86404:37	and she just gave me this woman 's name 0 * to contact *T*-1 E_S
86563:62	So \[ there 's , \+ I do n't , think 0 there 's \] any way 0 * to control the criminal element *T*-2 as far as guns is concerned *-1 because , N_S
86664:42	* living in Dallas there 's not that many places 0 * to go *-1 shoot *T*-2 E_S
86728:56	I think 0 there is a lot of responsibility *ICH*-3 on any of us gun owners * to make * sure that whoever *T*-1 is around us is at least safe and knows how * to use one *T*-2 . E_S
86825:40	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] immediate need * to show some sort of violence *-1 to settle \[ th- , \+ the \] argument . N_S
86946:22	Well , nobody feels responsibility * to do something . E_S
87044:41	And it 's really , really kind of a neat thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
87231:67	We all are n't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths \[ and , \+ and \] time 0 * to , you know , \[ sh- , \+ t- *T*-1 , \] N_S
87265:48	In fact , uh , I just got back from a shopping trip 0 * to \[ purch- , \+ purchase \] the cold cuts *T*-1 E_S
87506:34	Uh , my husband and I had this great desire *-1 to go *-2 see a comedy E_S
87806:27	that 's on my list 0 * to see *T*-1 . E_S
88088:41	and \[ we , \+ we \] had , nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with it . E_S
88375:34	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S
88416:47	But I think , 0 it 's a nice kind of way 0 * to be spoiled *T*-1 . E_S
88724:136	\[ But , \+ uh , so \] when you are first going to school *T*-4 \[ that , \+ \] you kind of have the luxury of *-1 being able *-2 to have some latitude in * choosing the place 0 * to go *T*-3 . E_S
89135:91	They say 0 if \[ you really want *-1 to be , \+ uh , you really want \] some suspense , that 's the one 0 * to see *T*-2 . E_S
89526:48	And with these decking that a corporation and a large MUMBLEx area for the trees to come up N_S
89896:32	That is an intriguing type of book 0 * to be reading *T*-1 and trying *-2 to keep up on things like that . E_S
90286:59	but learning disability , unless you are schooled *-1 in the types of things and ways 0 * to help a child like that *T*-2 , then it makes it real difficult E_S
90370:19	they have the ability * to be selective . E_S
90602:40	So , I think 0 people feel less of a desire * to really go . E_S
91389:47	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't really have the time 0 * to read the whole thing *T*-1 , E_S
91411:232	and \[ he really , \+ this man really \] shed some light on , um , some , aspects \[ of \+ of \] Bach 's genius \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and , \] \+ you know , the , \[ and \+ \] more sociological things , you know , like \[ the , \+ the \] idea \[ that , \+ um , that \] \[ music , \+ \] * to be a musician was as much , um , of a family occupation as anything . E_S
91449:71	um , and I 'm supposed *-1 to decide whether I think 0 this man might be a worthy person 0 *T*-2 to be \[ a , \+ \] you know , in that position on the board E_S
91467:31	Well , that 's a neat thing 0 * to be involved *-1 in *T*-2 .
91480:57	I think 0 that 's probably \[ a , \+ sort of a \] thing 0 * to do *T*-1 in small colleges , E_S
91825:49	\[ And , \+ and , \] uh , it was an enormous task 0 * to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping *T*-1 . E_S
91996:32	and , That 's a good family place 0 * to go *T*-1 , E_S
92060:27	because she really has a great desire * to do that , E_S
92201:22	There 's not enough time * to go *-1 see everything , and then to afford *-1 to see everything . E_S
92203:120	I guess 0 that 's why we need *-1 to plan for retirement *T*-3 , so when we do have the free time *T*-2 , we 'll have \[ the , \+ the \] means 0 * to , uh , pursue our dreams *T*-4 . E_S
92408:30	and then when it comes time for him to throw her over *T*-2 , well , \[ the , \+ the \] teenaged son the night before tried *-1 to save her by *-3 hiding her . E_S
92515:47	and \[ I , \+ I \] just do n't have that much time * to sit and watch the whole thing . E_S
92537:23	I do n't have time *-2 to sit , I know 0 *T*-1 . E_S
92612:68	\[ and I , \+ and that \] concerned me , that people were using it as a way 0 * to get rid *-3 of things 0 they just did n't want *-4 to set *T*-1 at the curb or take to the dump *T*-2 , E_S
92848:74	and pretty soon \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] figuring out 0 that 's not such a bad way E_S 0 * to go *T*-1 .
92977:63	\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 it 's , uh , just McDonald 's effort 0 * to reduce the number \[ of , \+ of \] styrofoam , uh , boxes that they use *T*-1 , for hamburgers and stuff *T*-2 , E_S
93040:73	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to , uh , take two kinds of vacations , the vacations * to visit family and the vacations * to just have a week *-2 being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that . E_S
93180:27	We still have a lot 0 *-1 to see *T*-2 , though . E_S
93219:27	that will be a pleasure 0 * to visit *T*-2 and get *-1 to know *T*-2 . E_S
93329:39	\[ when , \+ when \] I spend enough money * to go overseas *T*-1 , N_S I , go for a long time . E_S
93436:36	Well , um , that 's a hard question 0 * to answer *T*-1 because I do physical things , but I do n't always set out for them to be exercise . E_S
93729:84	I guess 0 if you care , or if \[ your wife , \+ your future wife , \] uh , gives you a reason 0 * to care *T*-2 which *T*-3 helps . E_S
93788:29	Bread , do you have bread 0 *T*-1 to go with it ? E_S
94106:62	and now it 's Lake Texoma , because that 's more central location 0 for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to *T*-1 . E_S
94142:81	And then they have generally a show or an auction or something *ICH*-4 on Saturday night 0 *T*-3 to help *-1 raise funds 0 *T*-2 to cover the costs of such . E_S
94205:52	they have generally a volleyball net set * up and horseshoes , uh , 0 * to pitch *T*-1 , E_S
94214:24	So there 's lots 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
94225:21	and it 's a chance * to see some of the relatives 0 you do n't see *T*-1 all year long except that once a year . E_S
94485:64	I mean , just because their kids had the ability \[ and the , \+ and the \] drive *-1 to \[ do , \+ try \] and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know , E_S
94490:88	\[ It shows , \+ I think 0 it shows \] that the parents have some , uh , desire \[ for , \+ for \] the kid to \[ do , \+ do \] well , you know , E_S
94508:136	I would try *-1 \[ to , \+ I guess , to \] see about * getting parents more involved , \[ with , \+ \] try \[ * to , \+ *-1 to \] come up with more ways 0 * to do that *T*-2 . Uh , uh , uh , stress the importance of education to \[ both \+ both \] the parents and the students , and , uh , \[ more , \+ more \] classes \[ that \+ I think that \] *T*-3 are , N_S
94536:62	and uh , you do n't have \[ any , \+ any \] kind of a good environment 0 *-1 to live in *T*-2 , you know , E_S
94603:60	However in today 's environment it *EXP*-3 may be more critical * to have the ability 0 * to interact in large groups , simply because that 's the way 0 our young people \[ are , \+ are \] dealt *-1 with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
94641:46	but still they have \[ an op- , \+ an opportunity \] 0 * to be with other children *T*-1 E_S
94660:48	and she was telling me that she was given *-1 the opportunity 0 * to manage a day care center *T*-2 , E_S
94794:42	But when time came *-6 to direct their ability 0 * to make choices to develop the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to need *T*-4 *-2 to interact with other people *T*-3 *T*-5 , I felt like I needed some strong influence there . E_S
94830:34	So I knew 0 it was time 0 * to go back to work *T*-1 . E_S
95131:49	and it 's just \[ a , \+ a \] very handy tool 0 * to have *T*-1 . E_S
95230:24	and that gives me the opportunity * to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if I ca n't think of some thing 0 * to tell the trouble shooter *T*-1 while we 're on the phone . E_S
95266:24	unless an employer has a reason *-1 to believe that \[ his , \+ \] uh , the work competency \[ of , \+ of \] the \[ employ- , \+ employee \] \[ is , \+ is \] hurting the business . E_S
95363:17	that 's enough * to make anybody paranoid . E_S
95389:53	There are so many people \[ with , \+ with \] their petty axes 0 * to grind *T*-1 E_S
95507:26	If I had something 0 * to hide *T*-1 , it 's one thing , E_S
95516:59	\[ And , \+ and then \] they say , well , if you give them the right * to do this , then they 're going *-1 to take some other right away from you , E_S
95521:31	I think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything , E_S
95964:46	boy that 's \[ a nice , \+ a nice \] place 0 * to visit *T*-1 . E_S
95976:26	and we did not have a chance * to do that . E_S
96017:25	\[ enough , \+ enough \] * to make it . N_S
96191:37	I think 0 there 's still a lot 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 , though . E_S
96304:41	but I think 0 they have got a long way 0 *-2 to go *T*-3 . E_S
96320:43	So , there are \[ some , \+ some \] strides 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 there . E_S
96908:27	otherwise , I will guard their ability * to have quiet time . E_S
96976:28	If you do not have the time *-1 to talk to yourself , who are you going *-2 to talk to *T*-3 . E_S
97318:39	I have heard 0 it 's a rough age 0 * to put them into a , N_S
97427:183	and we \[ cou- , \+ might \] even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis . That I watch , their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *T*-4 , or if she wants an afternoon off . Even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work . Uh , and not be bothered *T*-5 , E_S
97906:62	I think that , uh , I can highly recommend that movie \[ this , \+ \] 0 * to see *T*-1 . E_S
97919:40	Uh , in order *-1 to get a decent movie 0 * to have *T*-2 on a weekend , you 've got *-1 to rent it on Thursday . E_S
97954:76	but , uh , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's fun , \] \+ it 's a fun \] thing 0 * to do *T*-1 * to get out and be entertained *-2 for once . E_S
97995:63	We 've been waiting for \[ a , \+ a \] good movie out this summer 0 for the kids to see *T*-1 . E_S
98004:40	but we can generally find something at the store 0 for them to watch *T*-1 . E_S
98071:31	well , that 's a good one 0 * to put *T*-1 on the list . E_S
98639:43	and , uh , I do n't know that juries have a right * to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards , E_S
98712:140	Well , What I wear *T*-1 sometimes depends \[ on , \+ on \] how cold I think 0 the school might be *T*-2 or what room I might be in *T*-3 since I 'm a sub , and have different rooms 0 * to go to *T*-4 . And always carry a sweater . E_S
99083:45	or , you know , there 's all of these areas 0 * to look at *T*-1 in * making the decision . E_S
99723:80	MUMBLEx \[ we do n't e- , \+ we do n't \] catch it either , mainly because my husband rarely has time 0 * to mow the yard *T*-1 . E_S
99816:31	and they do n't have any place 0 * to put it *T*-1 E_S
100267:24	and there 's nothing 0 *T*-1 to hold them there in College Station since they 're retired . E_S
100302:37	and , uh , I had opportunities in high school , * to work in some programs , um E_S
100411:52	and \[ maybe , \+ uh , maybe \] this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *T*-1 . Um , if we 've lost some of that E_S
100446:56	You know , I think 0 this is certainly a possible way , um , 0 * to handle it *T*-1 E_S
100449:38	and I think 0 that 's a good place 0 * to start again *T*-1 . E_S
100695:46	Now if they do n't , I hope 0 they have the flexibility * to be able *-1 to change a child that *T*-2 really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse *-3 to work with them . E_S
100771:28	And * let everyone have an opportunity * to reach higher education if they 're willing , you know , *-1 to work and have , uh , some ability . E_S
100975:30	This is something that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff 0 they do *T*-3 . E_S
101475:70	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S
101475:84	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S
101629:39	I just think 0 that 's the best thing 0 *T*-1 to have happened , E_S
101707:56	So we 've really been talking about the foods , you know , 0 for him \[ to , \+ to \] be sure *-2 to eat *T*-1 E_S
101707:64	So we 've really been talking about the foods , you know , 0 for him \[ to , \+ to \] be sure *-2 to eat *T*-1 E_S
101765:37	I mean there 's plenty of things 0 * to talk about *T*-1 there . E_S
101808:26	that 's a bad tangent 0 * to get on *T*-1 . E_S
102436:23	if you have a chance * to rent it , at least , N_S
102600:29	That 's not an easy part 0 * to play *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
103110:33	But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S
103168:47	\[ It , \+ it 's \] still got a long way 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
103203:26	We have one earth , 0 *-2 to live on *T*-1 E_S
103435:66	\[ from , \+ from \] what I hear *T*-1 about jail life * is not any way 0 * to live *T*-2 . E_S
103515:79	Well , maybe if they could , uh , N_S if they had more money or \[ more , \+ more \] resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *T*-1 , N_S
103786:72	so we 've had a lot of stuff , you know , friends \[ and , \+ and \] things 0 *T*-1 to do with music that constant , N_S
103840:26	you got a little ways 0 * to go *T*-1 , too . E_S
104293:49	And , uh , someone said 0 that was a lot of fun 0 * to go *-1 do *T*-2 . E_S
104366:49	Uh , it does seem *-2 to be a lot of habits 0 * to break *T*-1 . E_S
104369:91	and so \[ they , \+ they \] tended *-1 to want *-2 to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things 0 * to do *T*-3 *T*-4 , E_S
104471:33	so there were a lot of bottles 0 *T*-1 to be returned *-2 E_S
104652:118	\[ If I , \+ if I \] go on an airplane ride or something , I 'll stop in and pick up \[ a , \+ you know , a \] COSMOPOLITAN or something 0 * to read *T*-1 on the airplane . E_S
104785:27	I 've had several minutes 0 * to think about this *T*-1 after I , uh , N_S
104798:40	Of course , then we would n't have any room 0 * to put people *T*-1 , E_S
104860:54	\[ I , \+ I \] honestly feel 0 if people have nothing 0 * to hide *T*-1 , they should n't have a problem with it . E_S
105003:57	If you ever got it dumped *-1 over , though , it was a mess 0 * to get *T*-2 back up . E_S
105016:68	But , uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a \[ nice , \+ nice \] hobby 0 * to have *T*-1 . E_S
105088:27	I do n't have anybody 0 *T*-1 to teach me either . E_S
105090:22	You need somebody 0 *T*-1 to kind of tell you what * to do *T*-2 , E_S
105100:26	Where is your favorite place 0 * to go *T*-2 *T*-1 ? E_S
105175:57	because it was n't a tremendous \[ thing , \+ amount of things \] \[ 0 * to do *T*-2 . \+ That I wanted *-1 to do *T*-3 \] there . E_S
105197:39	I know 0 this is a real good time 0 * to go *T*-1 , because they are having so many activities and special shows . E_S
105322:29	Oh , there 's too much 0 * to see *T*-1 really . E_S
105326:73	Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the way 0 * to , N_S
105449:55	because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S
106014:50	So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a very good place 0 * to eat *T*-1 , The Blue Mesa Grill . E_S
106021:42	This is going *-1 to give me some more places 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
106068:49	but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
106075:40	at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
106107:21	and we made the decision * to put her in a nursing home . E_S
106116:21	so I made the decision * to put her in a nursing home , E_S
106137:28	It 's not her favorite place 0 * to be in *T*-1 . E_S
106158:32	so it just became too much 0 for me to handle *T*-1 , E_S
106565:44	and now it just seems just such a large amount of money 0 * to spend *T*-1 \[ that , \+ that \] we do have a used car , E_S
106612:42	and we still know now that we have this car 0 * to put all the miles on *T*-1 . E_S
106740:33	and there is n't anything left * 0 * to spend *T*-1 anyway . E_S
106911:31	Well , that 's the best thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
107048:49	And , of course , there you know you have a specific place 0 * to put your paper *T*-1 . E_S
107303:33	Two bits I 'll get a man 0 *T*-1 to talk to me , because they get stuck *-2 doing it all . E_S
107465:50	the only thing is 0 if they do n't vote , they have no right * to complain . E_S
107473:45	and then if I 'm unhappy with it , I have the right * to express my opinion . E_S
107507:57	I 'm sure 0 all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks 0 * to go for absentee balloting *T*-1 . E_S
107723:37	* really is n't that much for elderly people 0 * to live on *T*-1 . E_S
107759:27	I do n't know much 0 * to say *T*-1 about it . E_S
108365:62	and , uh , \[ a lot of it \[ is , \+ has \] a lot 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , \+ or some of it has a lot 0 *-4 to say *T*-1 , \]
108370:41	I do n't think 0 they have a whole lot 0 *-2 to say *T*-1 , even . E_S
108556:52	I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fall back on *T*-1 , E_S
108556:60	I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fall back on *T*-1 , E_S
108688:34	Well , maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
108884:40	My parents had five children and really did n't make enough money * to send any of us to school . E_S
109141:21	and I have a tendency * to work late . E_S
109164:17	No mother 0 * to talk to *T*-1 . E_S
109631:25	is Coppell a nice area 0 * to live *T*-1 ? E_S
109633:31	Oh , it 's a wonderful place 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S
109935:58	and , it *EXP*-1 's nice \[ that , \+ that \] we could have the choice * to stay home . E_S
109947:120	and , you know , they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages , you know , \[ like I , \+ \] because I did n't have really all that much 0 * to talk about *T*-1 , uh , where career and things like that were concerned *T*-2 , E_S
109981:67	so , I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
110347:40	and the clicker comes in when it 's time 0 * to *T*-1 , N_S
110675:35	you 've got *-1 to have something 0 * to add *T*-2 to it or something E_S
110865:31	but they did n't have the money 0 * to restructure *T*-1 , E_S
111032:25	So now you have the chance * to really create \[ and , \+ and \] spread out . E_S
111047:58	and I start *-1 looking forward to , you know , * having other things 0 * to do *T*-2 with my MUMBLEx . E_S
111348:61	and so I decided , well , you know , this would really be a nice dog 0 * to have *T*-1 , E_S
111371:40	and we stopped along the way and had a bite 0 * to eat *T*-1 E_S
111553:29	and when we have something 0 * to celebrate *T*-1 *T*-2 , we head to Houston 's . E_S
111566:30	so , that 's our nice place 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
111629:112	and , uh , I was thinking about it after I got off the phone , \[ that , \+ that \] I really , you know , wish that there was some way 0 * to , uh , send a message *ICH*-1 to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that *T*-2 E_S
111676:84	I do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any \[ deterrent ag- , \+ uh , you know reason \] 0 * to not use capital punishment *T*-1 . E_S
111846:40	but our favorite when you have a little more 0 * to spend *T*-1 *T*-2 , is * to go to Taiwan or May Dragon . E_S
111859:28	but it 's a very elegant nice place * to eat . E_S
112090:56	now \[ what is your , \+ what 's your \] child 's favorite place 0 * to eat *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
112169:78	my rule is that they ca n't play a sport the same time of the year , because there 's just not enough of me * to drive them around everywhere . E_S
112527:52	Those are the , probably \[ the bestes- , \+ the best \] group 0 * to have *T*-1 . E_S
112585:51	Most of them do n't really feel that it 's a great place 0 * to leave their kids *T*-1 . E_S
112797:158	I can say that I think 0 \[ my , \+ my \] favorite spots are still \[ * to go , \+ *-1 to go \] where there 's mountains \[ and , \+ and \] a lot of trees \[ and , \+ and \] wildlife 0 * to view *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
113033:36	Well , there is so much about it 0 * to like *T*-1 . E_S
113262:32	I did n't really have the money 0 * to do it *T*-1 E_S
113343:26	They really do n't have enough * to keep them busy * to keep their noses \[ at , \+ \] in their own business of what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
113541:64	Well , see \[ we were under , \+ uh , the state 's prisons were under \] a mandate * to , uh , N_S
113723:123	Uh , you know , um , \[ it , \+ it \] could even be done *-1 \[ while they 're doing another job , \+ while they 're doing , you know , a job 0 *T*-2 to make money . \] E_S
113792:104	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] turn that around *T*-4 that everybody , N_S
113792:112	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] turn that around *T*-4 that everybody , N_S
113805:74	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ that 's , \+ I think 0 that 's \] a really important lesson 0 * to learn *T*-1 . E_S
113948:38	and they 're trying *-1 to get permission for his mother to come to America *-2 to like help *-3 care for the kid and that sort of thing . E_S
114052:76	but , uh , there seemed *-1 to be enough antifreeze *ICH*-2 \[ in there , \+ you know , left * \] * to do that E_S
114150:49	so I 've been thinking , 0 especially now is a good time 0 * to buy a car *T*-1 . E_S
114269:20	More fun things 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
114307:71	\[ \[ I , \+ I did n't , \] \+ I did n't \] set the time or anything 0 *T*-1 to , uh , N_S

114394:72	\[ \[ It , \+ it seems , \] \+ it seems \] to me that we should have the ability * to designate with the phone company that we do n't want *-1 to receive calls like that . E_S
114458:88	\[ And these , \+ and these \] people may in fact be just looking *-2 to \[ s- , \+ find \] an unoccupied house 0 * to rob *T*-1 . E_S
114662:67	They 'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now E_S and it 's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that . E_S
114753:29	did they give you a number 0 * to call *T*-1 ? E_S
115410:26	that 's a great thing 0 * to do *T*-1 , you know , really . E_S
115461:48	I 've always thought 0 that would be a real fun thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
115576:45	I just do n't know if I 'd have the time 0 * to use it *T*-1 . E_S
115647:50	I 've never wanted *-1 to *?* bad enough * to make any effort * to do it , you know . E_S
115865:24	Uh , I have a tendency *-1 to , N_S
115896:51	Uh , there has *-1 to be some way , I think , 0 * to equalize education opportunities *T*-2 . E_S
116037:36	Anyway , so , where 's your favorite place 0 * to go *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
116139:52	\[ I lo- , \+ I know \] a lot of good places 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
116268:48	Anyway , so we 're supposed *-1 to be talking about places 0 * to go *T*-2 E_S
116434:30	so we have all this 0 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look forward to *T*-2 , E_S
116434:38	so we have all this 0 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look forward to *T*-2 , E_S
116525:109	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S
116525:117	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S
116605:106	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] \[ if , \+ if \] there 's no one else around , you know , it 's just me and I have a chance * to listen to something , I 'll turn that on ,
116895:36	But he likes *-1 to have a spot 0 * to keep all of \[ his , \+ his \] piddling things *T*-2 . E_S
116908:94	and I at one time was going *-1 to fix up when one of my daughters left *T*-2 , a bedroom to where I had a room 0 * to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff *T*-3 *T*-4 , E_S
117970:97	So I got under there and messed with \[ \[ the , \+ the ten- , \] \+ \[ that , \+ uh , that adjustment \] \] 0 *T*-1 \[ to make , \+ to \[ t- , \+ tighten \] \] it up E_S
118205:29	and you do n't have it 0 * to give *T*-1 it to them . E_S
118719:34	but we seem *-1 to be lacking the ability * to take a stance . E_S
118873:50	you know , of course there 's still a lot of work 0 *T*-1 to be done *-2 , E_S
118874:89	and then when you get it completely , you know , the shell finished *T*-1 , uh , you still have a lot of stuff 0 *-2 to do *T*-3 inside , E_S
119200:26	Fishing 's a good way 0 * to do that *T*-1 , E_S
119480:63	and , uh , you know , I still do n't have \[ any , \+ anything \] 0 *-1 to do *T*-2 there , E_S
119971:61	I started *-1 doing it as \[ a , \+ \] um , just something fun 0 * to do *T*-2 , E_S
120055:48	Well , gee I guess 0 there really is n't too much 0 * to talk about *T*-1 on hobbies . E_S
120262:61	Um , \[ do \+ \] the skunk , uh , was it kind of like a cat 0 * to have *T*-1 around the house ? E_S
120336:29	That 'd be the best way 0 * to be *T*-1 . E_S
120520:45	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] a great place 0 * to go *-1 camping *T*-2 , E_S
120590:28	well , really the ideal times 0 * to camp in this area *T*-1 are early spring , and , \[ in , \+ in \] the fall . E_S
120901:204	Uh , sometimes when I hear \[ \[ what , \+ what \] they 're , \+ \[ even what , \+ even what \] the politicians are \] making *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that *T*-3 , uh , I think 0 that 's just a bit too much 0 * to be paying them *T*-4 , uh , E_S
120966:51	Well , they got so many hidden taxes , that it *EXP*-1 's really hard * to figure out how much you are paying *T*-2 , because , * go to a grocery store , something like that , and you 're paying a little tax here E_S
121040:56	\[ I have a , \+ uh , when I have an \] area 0 * to do *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] always had a big garden and enjoy *-3 working on lawns \[ and , \+ and \] everything . E_S
121496:103	If I was having a dinner party I would probably , um , have \[ \[ some , \+ um , some , \] \+ uh , um , some \] fruit 0 * to start with *T*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and , um , probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some , uh , uh , salsa and chips *ICH*-2 around and peanuts . E_S
121580:24	a , really good place 0 * to do entertaining like that *T*-1 . N_S
122339:32	Uh , that might be a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S
122366:45	There 's just so much , uh , more and less money 0 * to do it with *T*-1 . E_S
122415:37	I feel 0 that 's got a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S
122436:35	And , unfortunately , there 's not many places 0 * to get that money *T*-1 . E_S
122708:22	I barely get a chance * to read a newspaper now and then , E_S
122815:57	I would like *-1 to see them , uh , do more in that area 0 *T*-3 to make space travel more , uh , something that the ordinary person can , uh , \[ en- , \+ enjoy *T*-2 . \] E_S
122818:86	\[ I know 0 it 's \+ I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's \] in people 's nature * to be the first 0 *T*-1 to do something . E_S
122822:57	And \[ I , \+ I 'd \] love *-1 to be the first one 0 *T*-2 to step on a planet or some like , you know , N_S
122844:20	A better place 0 * to be *T*-1 or whatever , you know E_S
123143:48	\[ they are , \+ they are \] just a fun team 0 * to watch *T*-1 . E_S
123453:32	we 're supposed *-1 to have a chance * to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which *T*-2 will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather .
123790:93	So if * ever wanted , you know , pursue anything more than your nursing degree , \[ that , \+ that 'd \] be the place 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
123953:25	A lot of leaves 0 * to rake *T*-1 up too , I bet . E_S
124082:68	but , uh , \[ I 'm , \+ uh , I 'm \] pretty much out to the things 0 * to say *T*-1 . E_S
124088:52	Um , um , and I do n't think 0 this would have anything 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S
124427:34	but they had a new policy where in order * to get \[ your , \+ uh , your \] \[ license , \+ uh , your car license , \] uh , renewed *-1 , you had *-2 to meet the pollution standards *T*-3 E_S
124537:32	I know 0 it has nothing 0 *T*-1 to do with air pollution , E_S
124634:78	what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S
124824:35	well that was good that you had the opportunity * to do that . E_S
124877:29	so I automatically have the money 0 * to pay it off *T*-1 . E_S
125247:35	and Senator Moynihan 's , uh , proposal * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] cut there I think 0 *T*-1 \[ wou- , \+ makes \] a lot of sense . E_S

125252:32	I think 0 Senator Moynihan 's proposal * \[ to , \+ to \] cut the social security tax which *T*-1 is n't really \[ going * to , \+ going *-2 to \] beef \[ \[ up , \+ up , \] \+ up \] the social security program could make a lot of sense . E_S

125436:114	Um , when your child 's a little bit older , like a three year old *T*-3 you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it *EXP*-2 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap *T*-1 . E_S
125522:29	Um , there 's a place 0 * to look into *T*-1 , um , um , E_S
126813:34	do you have things like presentations *ICH*-3 0 *-1 to do *T*-2 or anything like that ? E_S
126974:90	\[ \[ the , \+ the \] move to , uh \+ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] Ukraine 's vote * \[ to , \+ uh , basically to \] \] secede and set itself up independently uh , is quite a remarkable , counts , E_S

127861:31	There 's never anything for you 0 * to go to trial as a witness in a case like that *T*-1 . Because you know 0 they tear you to shreds , especially those rich high powered lawyers . E_S

128397:142	Well , course MUMBLEx \[ it , \+ it \] is a big factor in * having an understanding of how much parents will pay *T*-3 and how much *T*-1 has *-2 to come from other sources and your willingness , one , * \[ to , \+ to \] work during the summer \[ or , \+ or \] part time .

128974:39	I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S
129828:42	I do find that I do n't have as much 0 * to throw *T*-1 away because all the bulky things \[ are , \+ are \] being tossed *-2 in with the recycling . E_S
129851:69	and , yet , what am I going *-1 to do *T*-4 when I have a couple double A batteries 0 * to toss *T*-2 out *T*-3 . E_S
129923:79	They 've already got all this money out on *-2 \[ hiring , \+ uh , getting the trucks and hiring \] people 0 *T*-1 to work them . E_S

130779:128	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
131085:69	Oh , I guess 0 the first thing has been \[ the , \+ uh , for the \] right , for women to vote . E_S
132550:27	They 're finding a way 0 * to tax you every time 0 you turn around *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
132573:118	Well , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the problem with the sales tax , of course , is 0 it 's an unfair tax across the board , uh , as far as ability * to pay , which \[ \[ a- , \+ allegedly , \] \+ allegedly \] taxes are supposed *-1 to be directed *-2 towards *T*-3 . E_S
132606:54	And , uh , I guess 0 if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks 0 * to spend *T*-1 on a car , uh , that 's their prerogative , you know . E_S
133169:41	And so , uh , I bought a used Yugo 0 *T*-1 just to be a \[ little , \+ you know , little \] car that I could care less about *T*-2 E_S
133185:68	\[ it 's just a , \+ it 's a \] cheap \[ little \+ little \] car 0 * just to go , you know , * run around town in *T*-1 E_S

133426:50	although it is not killing that many people now , it still has the opportunity * to get out of control and become a huge problem . E_S
133598:197	my understanding is 0 \[ what they 're try- , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] supposedly they 're trying \] *-1 to do *T*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money 0 * to spend *T*-5 , uh , E_S
133599:30	and if they have more money 0 * to spend *T*-1 , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity , uh , which in turn *T*-2 will generate revenue . E_S
133637:26	Um , at various places 0 * to look *T*-1 \[ for , \+ for \] * cutting the budget , first of all I consider more defense cuts than *?* are already planned *-2 depending on the world situation . E_S
133641:59	But there are various other areas such \[ as , \+ as \] farm subsidies that *T*-2 ought *-1 to be slashed *-1 . E_S
133721:114	That 's what *T*-1 drove me bananas , because , you know , I 'm going to the hardware store *-2 saying * give me plastic pipe \[ and \+ and \] cement 0 * to fit them together *T*-3 E_S
134117:108	\[ \[ if , \+ if , \] \+ if , \] uh , N_S my only consideration \[ were , \+ were , \] you know , * buying another car 0 * just to tool around town in *T*-1 and make , you know , brief trips and things like that , E_S I would \[ very , \+ very \] seriously consider *-2 buying one .
134158:24	they 're expensive cars 0 * to keep *T*-1 up when they need service *T*-2 , E_S
134431:27	that 's just too much 0 * to water *T*-1 all at once , E_S
134490:32	so there 's a lot of edging 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
134508:28	Um , if we had a chance * to move , I think 0 *T*-2 we 'd move back to somewhere that *T*-1 was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required \[ as , \+ as \] far as that goes . E_S
134575:46	they do n't like it in here because there 's nothing 0 * to eat *T*-1 E_S
134743:58	but I think 0 it 's real vital important for the future , you know generations 0 *T*-1 to come , E_S

140352:44	or are you so busy 0 you do n't have time 0 *-1 to do it *T*-2 ? E_S
140819:63	Well . \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if that has anything 0 *T*-1 to do with the intelligence , really , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] training bit , uh . E_S
140842:36	They say 0 that 's not the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 now . E_S
141140:31	Even * just finding the time 0 * to do the grocery shopping and everything *T*-1 . N_S
141352:62	and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive *ICH*-1 at tops * to get there and back . E_S
141362:72	So , we have got , uh , uh , my wife and I have , uh , a bit longer ways 0 * to go *T*-1 than most . E_S
141396:41	And see , my grandmother is the one that *T*-1 use *-2 to plan this stuff basically . E_S
141656:19	Always something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
142032:27	there really is n't much 0 * to say *T*-1 after you know , \[ \[ you , \+ uh , you know , you , \] \+ you \] tell the person \[ what , uh , news there , \+ uh , you know , \[ where their , \+ where they \] find their sources of information from *T*-2 \] E_S
142499:34	And mostly , it is just a way 0 * to , N_S
142526:42	But as far as camping , my wife and I have plans * to , uh , not really camp per se , but to drive up the , uh , you know , Highway One there in California uh , as soon as we get this house finished *-1 . E_S
142681:29	but we had all this trim 0 * to paint *T*-1 , and lots of it . E_S
142690:29	So , I hired this man 0 *T*-1 to come in and do it . A young kid . E_S
142751:96	But then that way you know you are assured 0 you did a good job than you are *?* , you know , if you hire someone 0 *T*-1 to do it . E_S
142990:82	You know , it *EXP*-2 's too bad that , uh , it has *-1 to be a forty-two year old guy 0 *T*-3 \[ to , \+ to \] lead \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Rangers , you know . E_S
142990:90	You know , it *EXP*-2 's too bad that , uh , it has *-1 to be a forty-two year old guy 0 *T*-3 \[ to , \+ to \] lead \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Rangers , you know . E_S
143204:55	but \[ there 's , \+ you know , there 's \] a lot 0 * to see *T*-1 here E_S
143436:29	* Seems like a nice place 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
143672:125	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a matter \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , talented people 0 *T*-1 to do it , \[ a- , \+ both as , \] quote , unquote students and as teachers , E_S
143942:53	I have *-1 to admit 0 that 's one of my favorite places 0 * to shop *T*-2 . E_S
143953:33	Well , Do you have anything else 0 * to say *T*-1 ? E_S
144599:31	well someone who *T*-1 's not ready *-2 to give up drugs , uh , You know . E_S
144614:114	You know , I guess 0 if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have *-1 to come first , I guess , as far as something 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-2 about it . E_S
144614:122	You know , I guess 0 if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have *-1 to come first , I guess , as far as something 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-2 about it . E_S
144629:111	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] I guess 0 you just have *-1 to take the two problems and see which *T*-2 is worse . Which *T*-3 is the most important 0 * to solve *T*-4 at the time E_S
144751:58	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] got *-1 to be a frightening way 0 * to spend an evening *T*-2 . E_S
145193:40	and , uh , there are a lot of things 0 * to think about *T*-1 E_S
145284:58	I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a real hard thing 0 * to do *T*-1 , even for people \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , university communities . E_S
145306:30	a cottage industry 's the best way 0 * to do it *T*-1 really , E_S
145308:31	Well , it is the best way 0 * to do it *T*-1 , interestingly . E_S
145312:133	I think that , uh , my own interest \[ in , \+ in \] \[ development , \+ human development \] leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way 0 * to go *T*-1 and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way 0 we learn *T*-2 . E_S
145703:62	\[ and , \+ and \] they always have , you know , two or three new ones 0 *-1 to add *T*-2 to the list , you know ,
146125:34	and I just do n't have the patience 0 * to just , you know , do something *T*-1 . E_S
146546:46	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S
146546:49	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S
146561:20	And another thing 0 * to think about *T*-1 , uh , on the positive side of the nursing homes here , N_S
146664:60	and that is very inconvenient cause I have *-1 to wait until I have enough of them * to make the trip worthwhile . E_S
146684:26	but there is no place 0 * to , N_S
146719:36	Plus you have *-1 to have a place 0 *-2 to store all of it *T*-3 E_S
146774:54	So , I have *-1 to throw them away cause there is no place 0 * to take glass *T*-2 . E_S
146848:51	It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places 0 * to put it *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
146862:57	Well , that does n't do me any good because I do n't have any place 0 *-2 to burn it *T*-1 . E_S
147134:44	Um , I guess 0 there 's been a lot of pressure * to , um , do away with the C F C 's in these spray bottles which , *T*-1 has been a real problem . E_S
147751:31	And that would be a next question 0 * to ask *T*-1 . E_S
147855:82	And then they also , you know , \[ ask can we eliminate , \+ do you think 0 we could make laws 0 *T*-1 to eliminate \] all corruption , E_S
147856:42	and I do n't think 0 we can make laws 0 *T*-1 to eliminate anything anyplace totally . E_S
148650:46	but uh , I would eventually like *-1 to make enough 0 *-2 to sell *T*-3 and quit my job E_S
148663:76	I 've wanted *-1 to do that , uh , but \[ just have n't , \+ just have n't \] mass produced enough * to do that . E_S
149636:52	and I would imagine that they do n't have many more than one 0 * to start with *T*-1 , either . E_S
149661:32	and that 's really kind of something 0 * to watch *T*-1 , uh , E_S
149901:39	I mean they 've got trillions of dollars 0 * to spend *T*-1 every year , E_S
150402:38	but it seems *-1 to be a good way 0 * to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage *T*-2 . E_S
150777:75	and , uh , while I 'm working , \[ I do n't get a , \+ I do n't get a \] chance * to read the paper a lot , E_S
150856:53	they give each candidate perhaps , you know , ten second blurbs in which * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] say *T*-1 ,
150857:81	\[ you , \+ you \] just ca n't get a full picture of , you know their message unless you have time 0 * to sit down \[ and r- , \+ and probably read \] something on it *T*-1 . E_S
150898:77	But a lot of the times , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] wish 0 I had the time 0 * to read all the stories in the newspaper *T*-1 , E_S
151426:39	Well , that sounds like kind of an important job 0 * to be , uh , straight on *T*-1 . E_S
151486:64	I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] they 're going *-1 to give you the opportunity * to turn yourself in , then they ought *-2 to , you know , go out of the way , I think , a little bit more *-3 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] \[ help you get , \+ help *-4 get you \] rehabilitated *-5 *-5 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] \[ get \+ get \] back at your job . E_S
151501:34	I mean , everybody 's got an equal chance * to get picked *-1 . E_S
151558:73	I really do n't see that that 's a \[ very , \+ very \] valid , uh , thing 0 for a company to say *T*-1 , E_S
151682:46	but an employer , really , I think 0 *T*-2 , has the right *-3 to hire someone on any basis 0 they want *-4 to *?* *T*-1 E_S
151686:71	and if they say 0 they do n't want smokers , I sort of feel like an employer should have the right *-1 to decide whether they want *-2 to allow that . E_S
151952:162	\[ So , \+ so \] I see us in \[ a kind , \+ somewhat of a \] catch twenty-two \[ unless we , \+ unless the \] banks or industry and \[ or \+ \] the government go together \[ and , \+ and \] come up with a way 0 * to , uh , have us as a part of the unemployed society be able *-1 to be gainfully employed *-3 again * converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting , uh , compound *T*-2 . E_S
151998:89	it 's burned *-1 so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , 0 * to , uh , form *T*-4 \[ because of , \+ by virtue of \] the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil \[ is , \+ uh , is \] not very volatile . You know , where gasoline , if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it 's gone *-3 . E_S
152048:28	Where do you find places 0 * to camp *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
152463:32	but then also there just is n't the ability * to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for * rewarding people for their performances . E_S
152711:64	Of course a lot of that 's also the ability *ICH*-1 \[ of , \+ of \] the defendant * to , uh , get a good lawyer . E_S
152982:34	so I really do n't have much time 0 *-1 to like read the newspapers and stuff *T*-2 E_S
153342:35	and so we just did n't have time 0 * to really train him *T*-1 E_S
153411:81	But , it 's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money 0 * to pay for it *T*-1 . E_S
153418:63	\[ and then , \+ \[ you , \+ you know \] but \] * have your legal right * to get a gun . E_S
153429:38	* Seems like it 's a good safe number 0 * to pick *T*-1 , you know . E_S
153498:101	I just do n't understand these people , you know , like when \[ they , \+ they \] decide 0 they 're going *-1 to buy a gun 0 *T*-2 to protect themselves *T*-3 . E_S
153591:65	uh , my wife , uh , \[ has so much , \+ uh , gets so much \] 0 * to do shopping with *T*-1 every couple of weeks E_S
153880:40	You guys , uh , do you get much of a chance * to hunt or anything E_S
153883:29	Uh , I have n't had a chance * to do any hunting since I 've been down here . E_S
153928:59	\[ if there 's \+ if there 's \] a way , you know , 0 * to limited it to people \[ that , \+ I do n't know that \] N_S
154098:71	and I thought 0 \[ that was \+ that was \] \[ pretty \+ a pretty \] good way 0 * to get news *T*-1 . E_S
154752:47	But , he had a lot of , uh , facts 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] give *T*-2 and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants *T*-1 were being shut *-3 down E_S
154752:55	But , he had a lot of , uh , facts 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] give *T*-2 and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants *T*-1 were being shut *-3 down E_S
154804:32	he says , well the best thing 0 * to do *T*-1 with plastics is * to burn them . E_S
154926:56	and that 's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people 0 *T*-1 to go with me E_S
155250:46	Um . I 've found 0 it 's the only reliable way 0 * to keep a check book balanced *-2 *T*-3 actually because what *T*-1 will happen is 0 my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother *-4 to total it E_S
155344:48	and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project 0 * to participate in *T*-1 E_S
155414:37	so , not much on that side of it 0 * to add *T*-1 to it . E_S
155433:63	so we 're stepping real careful and trying *-1 to see what *T*-2 's the best way 0 * to save \[ what , \+ the little bit that \] we do get *T*-3 , you know , on top of expenses every month *T*-4 . E_S
155635:31	like if you have a family 0 * to take care of *T*-3 , you know , of your own . E_S
155659:90	So \[ that , \+ that \] option sometimes is not available if they do not have \[ the , \+ \] uh , either Medicare or insurance 0 *T*-1 to cover it . E_S
155808:32	You just do n't have any time 0 * to do anything *T*-1 . E_S
155820:25	People would have time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
155898:100	but , uh , you know , that 's just nice \[ being , \+ you know , having \] a company being able *-2 to give you time 0 * to do that sort of thing and sort of , N_S
155922:29	be one of the last ones 0 *T*-1 to let *-2 go anyway . E_S
155996:34	I mean , there is a lot 0 * to learn *T*-1 , E_S
156201:35	\[ Or , \+ or \] they want the right * to make the same mistakes themselves * to bootstrap them up to \[ the way , \+ \] where we got to *T*-1 . E_S
156561:73	I guess 0 \[ if that 's \+ if that 's \] a weakness , that 's a good thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
156634:82	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] have \[ that mu- , \+ that many , \] you know , things 0 * to add *T*-1 up E_S
156754:67	but I think 0 we would make a bigger investment in kids , E_S we 'd have fewer decisions 0 * to make *T*-1 . Down the road , you know . E_S
156774:60	uh , I 'm afraid 0 I think that there are kids who *T*-1 just ought *-3 to be taken *-4 out of their homes and reared *-4 . E_S
156797:28	and if we had something 0 * to do *T*-1 before they get *-2 to be full-blown adult criminals , E_S
156815:102	Anyway , I dealt with two or three kids *ICH*-5 today that *T*-1 are going *-2 to end up where somebody \[ has , \+ \] making a decision what * to do *T*-3 with them *T*-4 . E_S
156825:33	but if you could find a way 0 * to prevent some of it *T*-4 , and I 'm not sure what it would be *T*-1 . It would be money better *ICH*-2 spent * than , N_S
157017:77	uh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 one of the main things that *T*-1 's really important 0 * to spend money on *T*-2 is education , not support \[ or , \+ or , \] research per se , \[ but , \+ but \] education because a lot of people sort of get drummed *-3 out of the work place and out of society , you know , kind of like lepers would *?* *-4 you know E_S
157642:42	But I 've never had \[ the , \+ the \] opportunity * to serve on a jury , although I 've been out here and registered for , I guess , about five years . E_S
157645:58	actually \[ I , \+ I \] thought that that would be very interesting thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
157673:52	and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire *ICH*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . E_S
157687:80	\[ You , \+ you \] would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude , uh , * to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response . E_S
157877:46	\[ there 's , \+ there 's \] always music books 0 * to buy *T*-1 . E_S
157951:72	So this is the big issue with us . Although I do n't recall *-2 marking it on my little things 0 * to talk about *T*-1 E_S
157952:36	but , perhaps they are little for words 0 *T*-1 to be said *-2 like day care and quality time E_S
158789:158	\[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I just do n't , \] \+ \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I d- , \] \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't \] foresee Bush making the decision * to invest a lot of manpower and money and , you know , \[ in , \+ in \] *-1 fighting a second battle . E_S
158853:129	\[ \[ It , \+ it , \] \+ you know it 's \] like \[ I have *-3 to work m- , \+ I have *-1 to work \] all the time just *-2 to make enough money * to pay the taxes . E_S
158903:26	but I did n't make enough money * to really make , too much of a difference . E_S
159089:43	And , uh , I really do n't have any job benefits 0 * to speak of *T*-1 . E_S
159169:30	but it would definitely be something 0 * to look into *T*-1 once I get my own . E_S
159180:28	That 's a whole other topic 0 * to begin with *T*-1 too E_S
159494:56	And , you know , the nursing home was the , you know , best facility 0 * to put her in *T*-2 . You know , besides * moving her up which *T*-1 is not a practical solution since both my parents work E_S
160303:47	I mean it *EXP*-2 's hard * to find places 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
160623:58	and I try *-2 to \[ at , \+ at \] least have a few minutes 0 * to look through that *T*-1 E_S
161342:37	and that 's , uh , an interesting one 0 for me to talk about *T*-1 since I have no children , E_S
161399:23	Maybe the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is * to , uh ,
161455:46	Oh , I do n't mind music that *T*-1 's difficult 0 * to listen to *T*-2 , E_S
162222:54	so I do n't need \[ a , \+ a \] mini van or such 0 * to , uh , haul people around in *T*-1 . E_S
162358:34	but * sounds like everybody 's had their chance * to make their money off it E_S
162436:70	but \[ there 's full , \+ uh , \[ th- , \+ there 's \] several \] medical plans 0 * to choose from *T*-2 , uh , that *T*-1 cover pretty much everything . E_S
162461:47	So that you 've got \[ small , \+ small \] things 0 *-1 to gripe about *T*-2 . E_S
162699:52	so this is a whole new thing 0 \[ for \+ , for \] us \[ to , \+ to \] have *-1 to put up with *T*-2 E_S
162699:60	so this is a whole new thing 0 \[ for \+ , for \] us \[ to , \+ to \] have *-1 to put up with *T*-2 E_S
162943:43	I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends 0 *T*-1 to babysit , E_S
162944:49	but I do n't envy anybody who *T*-1 's in that situation 0 * to find day care *T*-2 . E_S
163147:22	* has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with justice whatsoever . N_S
163417:48	uh , there 's too much labor involved * I guess 0 *T*-1 * to separate the stuff . E_S
163649:80	\[ and , \+ and \] supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn 0 * to retire *T*-1 *T*-2 , the money will be there for us . E_S
163717:64	\[ \[ The- , \+ the- , \] \+ there \] has *-1 to be some way 0 * to do it *T*-2 . E_S
163882:71	at least to my mind , Guns and Roses does n't have \[ too much of a message , \+ too much 0 * to say *T*-1 . \] E_S
164135:34	so that 's still got a couple years 0 *T*-1 to run E_S
164154:35	but , uh , realistically with , uh , the need * to take the kids to school , * probably have *-1 to have something that , uh , *T*-2 would n't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *T*-4 . E_S
164258:68	I think that we 're going *-1 to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years 0 *T*-2 to come . E_S
164265:73	Uh I 'd be satisfied with \[ a , \+ a \] good front wheel drive car when it comes time 0 * to replace the Sentra *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
164371:58	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's still an appropriate penalty 0 * to pay *T*-1 if they absolutely sure 0 they got the right guy E_S

164605:132	but , uh , it used *-1 to be 0 a long time ago , I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment *T*-2 , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right * to administer the punishment . E_S
164606:53	So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then \[ you had the right * to , \+ uh , if that person was caught *-1 and found *-1 guilty , you had the right * to , \] uh , execute that person . E_S

165047:46	uh , that has \[ a , \+ a \] whole lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it , you know , E_S
165085:30	and , there 's nobody 0 *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] sit them down and say , you 're going *-1 to do this . E_S
165085:38	and , there 's nobody 0 *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] sit them down and say , you 're going *-1 to do this . E_S
165089:54	Uh , just , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] take a notion * to do it , E_S
165108:35	* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ which *T*-3 has been , \+ you know , which *T*-4 is \] really nice , E_S
165370:45	and \[ I , \+ I \] had an occasion 0 * \[ to change , \+ to have *-2 to change \] the battery *T*-1 once , E_S
165636:22	you have something 0 *T*-1 to take it out . E_S
165787:73	Well , \[ we just have , \+ you know , we have \] a good friend that *T*-1 's about *-2 to move to Atlanta . E_S
165959:44	\[ that , \+ that \] would be a good deal 0 * to go with *T*-1 . E_S
166135:36	But I think 0 that has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with economic situation . E_S
166305:62	Uh , but I 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be blamed *-3 on the schools . E_S
166311:100	they *ICH*-1 're all three social issues and could be addressed *-2 by the government in any ways . And clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fix *T*-3 E_S
166311:108	they *ICH*-1 're all three social issues and could be addressed *-2 by the government in any ways . And clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fix *T*-3 E_S
166595:45	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] an interesting game 0 * to watch *T*-1 . E_S
166784:58	\[ I do n't think , \+ I do n't think \] 0 they have the right * to do that . E_S
166790:34	Oh , here 's *T*-2 an easy way 0 * to make some money *T*-1 . E_S
166965:42	but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual * to pay . E_S
167066:46	Well , preceding criminal record , according to the judicial process has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with the current crime . E_S
167076:53	during the trial as to whether they 're guilty or not has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with their background . E_S
167197:139	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S
167287:47	I suppose 0 you could say , well that has something 0 *T*-1 to do with potential for rehabilitation . E_S
167508:40	My parents do not have a whole lot of money 0 * to put *T*-2 into it . E_S
167777:31	and I also get my own money 0 * to do what I want *-2 to *?* *T*-1 . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing *T*-3 . E_S
167786:43	We 're finding that we have a lot more money 0 *-1 to spend *T*-2 on things like that . E_S
167804:43	and we know which month we 'll enough *ICH*-1 saved * * to go *-2 buy those . E_S
167923:57	So , I guess 0 \[ the problem is 0 the , \+ the thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is \] * to try *-2 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get some kind of motivation * to learn E_S
168436:28	and it 's a beautiful place 0 * to live *T*-1 . E_S
168469:34	And you do , obviously , have enough 0 * to live on *T*-1 E_S
168559:79	I think 0 I would rather *ICH*-2 0 a person go ahead and be put *-1 down than * give them the opportunity * to get out and do it again . E_S
168564:52	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] punish *T*-1 , especially criminals who *T*-2 seem *-3 to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done *T*-4 . E_S
168564:60	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] punish *T*-1 , especially criminals who *T*-2 seem *-3 to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done *T*-4 . E_S
168648:60	I mean \[ I , \+ I 'd \] hate *-1 to be the person 0 *T*-2 to pull the switch , you know , E_S
168774:38	I do n't have a great deal of time 0 *-2 to spend *T*-1 with the kids , E_S
168899:32	I had a little bit more time 0 *-1 to think about it *T*-2 . E_S
168986:36	Well , that 's kind of a difficult one 0 * to go into *T*-1 . E_S
169077:105	\[ for , \+ for \] years there has been an idea *ICH*-2 batted * around of * having some sort of alternative , uh , public service 0 for , uh , young people to go into *T*-3 , uh , after high school . E_S
169216:68	I think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it , N_S that 's a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] work it *T*-1 , with a neighborhood watch . E_S
169216:76	I think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it , N_S that 's a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] work it *T*-1 , with a neighborhood watch . E_S
169475:96	and \[ I can , \+ I can , \] you know , accept that some people think 0 it 's not *?* and can find better ways 0 * to use it *T*-1 . E_S
169520:65	We ended up *-2 watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something 0 * to eat *T*-1 and then zooming back and \[ ea- , \+ watching \] it some more . E_S
169548:23	probably the best things 0 * to do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * tie them with a rope and throw them in the water E_S
170143:57	and when the envelope was empty *T*-1 , then you did n't have any more money 0 * to spend *T*-2 in that area . E_S
170312:66	Uh , while I was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *T*-3 , *-1 trying *-8 to think of \[ what , \+ uh , uh , what \] things *ICH*-5 *T*-4 were important , uh , besides salary \[ and a , \+ and a \] job . I guess , uh , MUMBLEx list 0 I had scribbled *T*-6 down was the people 0 you worked with *T*-7 and maybe \[ the , \+ uh , the \] challenge of the work and , uh the working conditions , things like that . E_S
170385:48	and even at that , it would at least give the person time 0 * to look for another job *T*-1 because they know \[ that \+ MUMBLEx that \] there are problems E_S
170389:36	and , you know , there are reason 0 * to look for another job instead of * just dumping it on them all at one time *T*-1 . E_S
170414:35	Well at least that would give a person a chance * to look you know . Because the way 0 it is *T*-1 , a person really do n't have a chance . E_S
170540:79	if there were more than one child , I do n't know , \[ the- , \+ there \] would be no way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
170572:76	and so we really have *-1 to keep it together *-2 to get just her activities in and still have time 0 *-4 to spend *T*-3 with each other . E_S
170705:21	All the more reason 0 * to , uh , have \[ a , \+ a \] Honda *T*-1 . E_S
170932:46	but it 's also not fair because they have their own children 0 * to raise *T*-1 . E_S
170938:77	And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S
170952:51	* To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace 0 * to stay *T*-1 E_S
171052:38	And I think 0 it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
171113:29	but I have n't really had a chance * to talk to her about that for a while . E_S
171177:31	and so if they had business 0 * to do *T*-1 , they had *-2 to finish it , you know , three days in advance so they could get it through the mail . E_S
171208:39	Like we do n't stop and wait for things 0 *T*-2 to happen because we do n't have *-1 to *?* . E_S
171213:39	We do n't stop and wait for the things 0 *T*-1 to bake and this 0 *T*-2 to happen and that 0 *T*-3 to happen . E_S
171219:79	so they say 0 that 's really a bad thing . That you need *-1 to learn a lot of ways 0 *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] deal with that and get \[ your , \+ your \] time in between things . E_S
171219:87	so they say 0 that 's really a bad thing . That you need *-1 to learn a lot of ways 0 *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] deal with that and get \[ your , \+ your \] time in between things . E_S
171662:118	So , uh , right now , \[ we 're on , \+ we get \] \[ f- , \+ you know , aid from \] the state at this point because there 's no other way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
171674:47	and if I do n't work enough days then I do n't get enough * to meet the bills E_S
171861:45	I think 0 I know a little more than I use *-1 to *?* . E_S
171970:36	I think 0 it 's an , excuse 0 * to do nothing *T*-1 E_S
172017:43	there 's about six or eight guys that *T*-2 we use *-1 to go out for these games . E_S
172075:74	Uh , so that , uh , a judge , I think 0 *T*-3 , would be the most appropriate person 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] be able *-2 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . E_S
172075:87	Uh , so that , uh , a judge , I think 0 *T*-3 , would be the most appropriate person 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] be able *-2 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . E_S
172094:71	and if they 're judged *-1 guilty * would probably be in a better \[ pri- , \+ position \] 0 * to give an appropriate , uh , sentencing *T*-2 . E_S
172149:89	Because , I mean , gee whiz , if I \[ was , \+ \] uh , uh , did n't have that right , you know , * not to have a jury that ,
172287:31	and then the judge was the one 0 *T*-1 to do the sentencing . E_S
172296:27	and I have really resisted the impulse *-1 to get one for the home . Uh , up until , I guess , maybe about a year and a half ago , E_S
172495:57	uh , I guess 0 I do have \[ a , \+ a \] bone 0 * to pick *T*-1 with , uh , uh , the way 0 taxes are distributed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S
172699:81	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's really something that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] government ought *-6 to encourage *T*-1 more because , uh , there are all these complaints about how we 're not a saving country *T*-2 and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in , uh , Germany and Japan *T*-5 .
172852:224	Well , the thing of it is , 0 if I wanted *-1 to just , uh , you know , permanently become a book reader , I guess 0 *T*-3 I could just , uh , you know , uh , go on public assistance , uh , you know \[ \[ \[ lo- , \+ lo- , \] \+ look for , \] \+ uh , look for \] people 0 *T*-2 to , uh , take care of me . E_S
173610:171	Uh , \[ but \+ or \] whether \[ there 's just , \+ you know , a policeman has just \] made \[ \[ \[ a , \+ uh , a , \] \+ you know , a \] non , \+ a noncritical error , \] though be it not the right way 0 * to do it *T*-1 N_S
173682:139	Uh , one is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability * to function , then \[ I , \+ I \] think \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , I do n't have any problem at all with * testing that individual , you know , on the spot . E_S
174344:60	And so \[ he 'll , \+ he 'll \] sue just about anybody just for the chance * to get into court , and argue his case you know , E_S
174506:47	it would be great if we could find some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , use that * to boost the economy *T*-1 . E_S
174506:55	it would be great if we could find some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , use that * to boost the economy *T*-1 . E_S
174602:16	No need * \[ to use this anymo- , \+ to play around with this space stuff anymore . \] E_S
174728:101	I mean just because , like we said before , they do n't have enough room in the jails uh , you know , there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let *-1 out early . E_S
174905:43	And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] something 0 * to be aware of *T*-1 . E_S
174974:26	They probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it . E_S
175144:42	And that 's certainly is a lot of students 0 for one person to deal with *T*-1 on an every day basis .
175152:48	but more than that , I do n't think that they have the authority * to command the attention of the children . E_S
175476:67	And maybe \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-1 . E_S
175476:75	And maybe \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-1 . E_S
175738:75	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] on the whole I think 0 it , uh , probably was the wrong thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
175801:82	* Looking back , it seems like that was only partly true . That , uh , there might have been a better place 0 * to draw the line *T*-1 . E_S
175802:98	Uh , \[ I guess 0 you can , \+ I guess 0 you can \] say that \[ a , \+ a \] certain amount of resolve and willingness * to fight , uh , brought the cold war to an end . E_S
176096:91	And my intent was that whenever something *ICH*-4 went on sale that I really had *-3 to have *T*-2 *T*-1 , I would have the cash * to buy it right then and there . And not ever have *-5 to spend any money on interest . E_S
176158:21	It 's time for you to do these things then . Right ? E_S
176167:145	\[ But , \+ but , \] \[ un- , \+ unfortunately \] \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ my \] wife really feels as though \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] just been an inappropriate , uh , thing 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to , \]
176167:153	\[ But , \+ but , \] \[ un- , \+ unfortunately \] \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ my \] wife really feels as though \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] just been an inappropriate , uh , thing 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to , \]
176208:143	and \[ \[ w- , \+ why , \] \+ why \] would they be interested \[ in , \+ in \] your little turnip unless , you know , one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well 0 that 's somebody 0 * to molest *T*-1 , you know *T*-2 . E_S
176649:50	first off \[ we do n't , \+ we do n't \] have enough courage * to , uh , pick out the people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage , uh , because that would offend them , uh , \[ if they , \+ if they \] were n't *?* . E_S
177259:39	I think 0 they 're a very difficult group 0 * to integrate *T*-1 into , uh , society . E_S
177260:34	They 're very difficult , uh , group 0 * to find jobs \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , places for *T*-1 . E_S
177268:27	And it would have nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with political situations . E_S
177290:50	So \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] a lot 0 *T*-1 to be said *-4 for * having a steady stream of people who *T*-2 know how it is *T*-3 someplace else coming in . E_S
177396:59	and , uh , in fact I think 0 I was the first person in our department 0 *T*-1 to have my thesis published *-2 on \[ recyclable pa- , \+ recycled paper . \] E_S
177426:38	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a opportunity * to stay alive really . Instead of , you know , * \[ wasting \[ \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ the , \] \+ you know , the , \] \+ trying \] *-1 to exist on \[ the latency of my youth , \+ the good health of my youth . \] E_S
177623:26	That 's a good way 0 * to get started *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
177745:29	So . That 's a thing 0 * to consider *T*-1 is * to , N_S
